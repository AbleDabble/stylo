### Status 4

### The Plan for the Last 3 Weeks

Ian - Write functions for the GUI that link the verification/id/profiling models to the frontend display.


William - Build model for authorship identification and supporting classes and methods


Sam - Update the reddit scraper to handle errors and update model functions to work with the new scrapper.


Andy- Complete the twitter scraper and add error checking functionality.


### What was Done During Last 3 Weeks

Ian - Wrote methods that can activate the models and display basic results to the user.


William - Finished Authorship identification model. Began finding the best hyper-parameters to for authorship identification


Sam - Added error checking to the reddit scrapper which makes the function exit smoothly on an error, and returns appropriate values based on the error.


Andy- Completed the Twitter scraper so it can pull individual users or a list of users through a for loop. Added basic error checking to prevent the program from crashing on error.

 

### Successes

Ian - Finished the basic gui mock-up excluding the functionality.


Andy- Was able to complete the  Twitter Scraper and its functionality 


William - Completed the authorship identification model. Began integrating the identification and authentication models with the frontend.

Sam- Completed error handling and updating the verification function to use the new function.


### Roadblocks Challenges

Ian- Writing a display class that can show the results from the functions to the user.


Andy - Couldnâ€™t get usernames from the streamlistener (could only stream tweets  with specific filters). Double backed and tried a third method that worked out great and was easy to implement.


William - Organizing the data for efficient retrieval, and finding the best hyper-parameters for the identification model. 


Sam - PRAW documentation does not have clear return values which makes error handling difficult. Ran into an infinite loop issue caused by users having no viable comments


### Changes/Deviations from the Plan (if Applicable)

Ian - None

William - None

Sam - None

Andy - None


### Description of Goals for Next 3 Weeks

Ian - Continue working with the team to link the GUI back-end with the front-end display.


Andy - Help implement the twitter  scraper into the GUI. Add specific error checking functionality if need-be. Create a base database of 60 Twitter accounts to start.


Sam - Continue error handling and tying up the finished program.


William - Complete authorship profiling model
