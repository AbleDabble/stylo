## The plan for the last 3 weeks 
* Ian: Downloaded Python QT designer and created rough layouts for the visual portion of the software.

* Sam: Created a reddit developer application to use in praw web scraping corpus generation and started to lay out the framework for implementation.

* Andy: Created a Twitter developer account that will give me the tokens to properly access the Twitter API. Started working on python and Tweepy integration in version 3.8. Attended zoom meetings For project discussion.
* William: Research methods for authorship profiling, and the use of an embedding space as classification method when dealing with large amounts of data. 



## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks

So far we have written out a rough sketch of general design features such as: Graphical interface
 * Three modes of stylometry with tiles and general planning for qt creator.

 * Twitter and Reddit Corpus Gathering

 * Andy was able to get the Tweepy package installed and imported into a python project

 * Research for how to create a classification algorithm that doesn’t need to be completely re-trained at the

 * introduction of a new user

## What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom):
Ian: Downloaded Python QT designer and created rough layouts for the visual portion of the software.

Sam: Created a reddit developer application to use in praw web scraping corpus generation and started to lay out the framework for implementation. 

Andy: Created a Twitter developer account that will give me the tokens to properly access the Twitter API. Started working on python and Tweepy integration in version 3.8. Attended zoom meetings
For project discussion. 

William: Research methods for authorship profiling, and the use of an embedding space for extreme classification methods.


## Description of tasks completed

* Ian: I spent 3 hours working on rough layout along with an additional 4 attending meetings on zoom/discord.

* Sam: Spent 4 hours reading PRAW documentation, setting up developer account, and implementing
Authorization code to access reddit instances. Also attended meetings via zoom and discord.

* Andy: I spent 3 hours figuring out how to get Tweepy to be found through the interpreter to be able to get imported. Attended 4 meetings held across Zoom and Discord.

* William: I spent 4 hours reading papers about about recommendation algorithms in search of a method to create a classification method that won’t involve completely retraining the machine learning algorithm every time a new class is added.

## What are your accomplishments?

Ian: I have managed to roughly outline based on our design documents 3 to 4 window panes that have all of the

rough gui elements needed for our project such as selection buttons, c value entries, and handles.

Sam: Set up the developer account and was able to access a reddit instance.

Andy: Created/was approved for a Twitter developer account. Have found a potential solution to the tweepy problem. I was able to get Tweepy to import!

William: Found a corpus for authorship profiling that enables classification of individuals personalities based on reddit account flairs attached to users in a subreddit. 



## What solutions were successful?

Ian: Watching YouTube lecture series for QT/Python GUI design.
Andy: Solution- adding the “conda-forge” channel to the conda navigator. This allowed for Tweepy to get imported.


## Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?
Ian: I have tried to link the python code to the gui code, but am still struggling to learn the GUI designer tool.
Sam: Outside of misplacing variables when creating the reddit instance which lead to some very confusing errors, nothing major. I’m sure there are plenty to come.

Andy: No other problems have occurred for me yet, I am sure that some will arise once I get Tweepy to work.
I had also tried different methods of tweepy installation however, that's when I found out it was the interpreter
and not the installation that was having issues.

## Roadblocks/Challenges

Tweepy was struggling to be found by the package manager though it was installed properly 

## Describe the challenges

Learning new libraries and reading through documentation.

## Describe how you overcame them
We have been working by using sprints. We do a brief planning meeting where everyone talks about their
individual role in the project and what their plan is for their next programming cycle, then we re-meet and 
discuss challenges and solutions.

## What challenges are still left?


Sam is working on generating a corpus of reddit comments based on username.  

Ian still is working on learning the GUI designer tool.

Andy still needs to work with Tweepy to generate a corpus from tweets. The afterwards he will have to format the 

the tweets and the document to the proper specifications

Ultimately we still need to implement automation for web-scraping, change the current model we are using for authorship identification and build a set of models for authorship profiling that can be used to determine various qualities of a person. 


## Changes/Deviation from Plan
None

## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for next 3 weeks
Implementation of automation tools for web scraping, and creation and testing of authorship identification tool on the current reddit corpus.
