The four weapons safety rules that we use are simple. 

1. Treat every weapon as if it were loaded. 

2. Never point your weapon at anything you don't intend to shoot.

3. Keep your weapon on safe until you are ready to fire. 

4. Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you intend to fire.

You, as a tax payer, let your government give that much away, actually more since not every person pays taxes, to a church of some sort that you may or may likely not agree with.

Fyi, whHate to say it but no, it's not over. Not by a long shot. This hasn't escalated to the point of fixing anything. It's just hippie peace protests like the 60's and 70's.

I got out setting myself up to have the possibility to go back in. I got out bc I wanted freedom to do wild stuff while I'm young and also transition without dealing with as much drama.

But to explain in a little detail: someone with an issue with serotonin may feel depressed after sex, because the sudden drop in serotonin, which is responsible for stimulation and mood, causes a person to go from happy and stimulated to empty relatively quickly. Dopamine issues might make a I know I am because I experienced it first hand. As do most porn addicts. But aside from that, chronic abuse of drugs that affects the serotonin and dopamine parts of the brain, like Xanax, MDMA, lsd (in high doses), dmt, and adhd meds can cause permanent irreparable damage that also play a part in sexual relationships. There are examples of this iI think we should differentiate between asking how to apologise for a slip up and being deathly afraid of words. 

An example would be asking for help from a friend after making a light hearted anti-Semitic joke with a Jewish friend present without knowing. It's not said with bad intentions, but it's something that you would want to make sure you aYou also have to consider that along with the spike and sudden drop in serotonin, there is dopamine, oxytocin, adrenaline, vasopressin, and other chemicals that play a role in post coitus reactions.
