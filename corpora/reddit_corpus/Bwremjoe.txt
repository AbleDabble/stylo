I share your perspective quite a bit, although you need to still justify that stealing IS de facto wrong (Also see other comments). I personally phrase this by saying that we need not ever use the word ought when talking about morality.

I am personally more and more convinced that the word ought is just that: a word. It has no basis in reality. ThESSs are mathematical concepts that can be useful, but looking for them in the real world can be tricky. Asking if humans are an ESS is a bit like looking for the perfect circle and nature. You’ll find many objects that approximate a circle, but none of them is perfect.

That said, I’m sure there are lots of interesting papers to be found on GoogleYou could read into a concept called “The Error Threshold”. Although this concept has been mostly applied to abiogenesis and virus evolution, the theory is generalisable to ANY population. It shows that you can’t simply expose a population to more mutations to speed up evolution. Or more accurate; you can, but it has a hard limit, above which everyHumans aren’t the most developed, but I understand why it appears that way. We know a lot about the human body, much more than about say a crocodile. But that doesn’t mean we are more developed, we just investigated ourselves better (for our own interests). To see our intelligence as ‘special’ is like a crocodile saying “look how poorly developed tThe “convergent” part of convergent evolution is actually poorly defined, or even a subjective phenomenon. If you think they are sufficiently similar, and they arrived there sufficiently independent, then the answer to your question is yes.

Probably though, it’s better to be more descriptive when talking about these things. This is in general goodOn the short term, we can sometimes make predictions that are very accurate, especially as you mention in bacteria. But even for bacteria, longer timescales display a much greater number of possible of outcomes. Possibly this is similar to the so-called butterfly effect, where tiny differences eventually change the entire system.

I’ve recently attYou’re missing some key pieces of the puzzle here. Everything we currently know about epigenetics and plasticity (or as you called it, switching genes on/off) is *itself* shaped by natural selection. They are potentially exploited / modified, but for as far as they lead to disfavoured results, they are selected against. For example, it’s better to There are currently two competing hypotheses. 

One hypothesis takes the perspective of accumulating information in polymer molecules like RNA, DNA, and proteins. The “RNA world” is leading in this category, but people also study how life could have begun from short protein sequences called peptides. Other features of life, such as cells and metaboYou are correct, the number of species is classically thought to be limited by the number of different environments. However, organisms don’t just adapt to their environment, they also modify it. In that regard, occupying a niche can create new niches. For example, apes eat fruits, but leave the peelings, which are available for worms and insects, I think your comment is useful to unpack a little bit more.

These data proof that racial biases themselves are not hard-wired, but cognitive evolution entails a LOT more than merely hardwiring behaviours. Evolution has provided us with a programmable piece of software (brains), but certain programs run easier than others. For example, installing aAlthough I generally agree with this reply, I wanna push back a little, mainly to explore the topic / play devil’s advocate a bit. 

The fact that it is social, which we indeed know to be the case from studies on people and other animals, does NOT imply it cannot be influenced or even caused by evolutionary pressures. Evolution has clearly preparedI don’t think this is a fair assessment of how religion percolates societies. Religious ideas, such as souls, will cause trouble even when people are quite moderate about it. Somehow the United States still can’t get its act together about the ethics around abortion, because “life starts at the moment of conception“. From an evolutionary perspectivThe only way to fully fill the space between A and C fully, would be to find fossil evidence of every individual in between that has lived. Unfortunately, not everything gets fossilised, so we only may have a few points to go with. 

However, we also have the DNA evidence to back up the story. Sometimes we can even extract DNA from ancient species Yes this is possible. In fact, it cannot be mathematically impossible, as mutations have non-zero probabilities, and multiplying non-zero probabilities will never get you 0. Hence: possible.

About your concerns with the likelihood, 50.000 really isn’t that many on evolutionary timescales. Statistically, you have ~70 mutations neither of your parenThis post is a great example of the problems with the word believe. It has many meanings, and people sometimes accidentally change meaning mid-sentence. 

1) Do you have faith? Use the word faith.

3) Are you convinced? Use the word convinced.
4) Do you believe? Go back and reconsider 1-3. :D

People have stumbled upon this paradox in modern-day organisms. It turns our that if you sufficiently deplete a cell of ATP, you can’t really reboot it anymore just by adding glucose.You could read into our knowledge on “immune escape”. Here’s my take: even the fast-mutating viruses cannot just change EVERYTHING about them to avoid our immune system. Some parts of viruses are so essential that they really have to be precisely the way they are, so if you target a vaccin against that part of the virus, it can’t “escape” as easilyAs others mentioned, there is a so-called “founder effect” going on. Once something has filled a particular niche, and has even become fitter over time, it is pretty much impossible for a new (arguably still crappy) life form to take over. Most simple computer simulations will confirm this, although we of course do not know exactly how to simulate I think it is important to note that physical limitations, generally speaking, manifest at much longer timescales than behavioural differences. The ring species phenomenon operates at relatively short evolutionary timescales, and therefore is probably dominated by examples where interbreeding is hindered due to behaviour. To get a physical incompatPeople like to imagine how scientific theories are competing, and that in the end only one will be true. But note how that was often not the case earlier in scientific history. Newtons laws aren’t an alternative theory to gravity, they are still fully encapsulated within Einstein theories. 

I suspect the same will be true for the gene-centered theWar is actually very common, not only in other mammals (chimps, gorillas, lions), but even in bacteria. Microbial ecologists call this “antagonist interaction”, and it is thought to happen especially when food resources are (locally) abundant, but space is an overal scarcity. Under these conditions, populations that occupy the “good spots” will me If that’s your definition of morality, then it cannot be objective as I (like I said) don’t agree that it exists at all. 

However, I think there is something similar we could call objective ethics, which describes what we will inevitably do given prerequisite knowledge. Simply put, in almost all cases: “the only way to be wisely selfish is to careLet’s not get caught on words to easily. If you define subjective as the opinion of individuals, of course your statement becomes true. But it is also circular. You’re basically saying nothing more than “opinions are opinions”, and we have made no further progress.

Subjectivity can also be discussed as a first-person perspective of the world, whicI think you misunderstood me. I am not saying people are not doing this type of research anymore. It is however not something that is easily funded, as people (funding agencies) see this topic as more or less resolved. We have looked at fossils for decades upon decades, and never have we found anything remotely contradictory for evolution. There’s Geesh. Perfectly normal intelligent people can say and believe the weirdest things when religions are concerned. Think about it, and stay with the thought for a little while: if absolute and arbitrary are the same thing then **anything can mean anything**. It’s like arguing in the absence of logic. You **could** do that, but it’s just a silly wasteWhenever you use the word “fact” and “ought” in the same sentence, please note how incoherent that sounds. Ought it one of these words humanity had invented for themselves, which was no factual counterpart outside of language. I am not simply ignoring the is/ought divide, I am altogether claiming it doesn’t exist. There is no is/ought divide just lThe distinction between objective and subjective is much less clear than our language suggests. Ask yourself, is it possible for this universe to give rise to subjects that really don’t give a damn about what they experience? Are the objective and subjective entirely independent? 

You are basically equivocating “subjective” and “opinion”, which acYour comparison with the murder case is not actually in your favour. Suppose we have a town where all 9.999 people claim the 10.000th person was murdered. If they are correct, then investigation will allow us to improve upon the naive 1/9999 probability. But what if they are all wrong? There was no murder at all, and the victim just looked murderedYou are correct in assuming they can both be true. The “gradual” and “punctuated” models of evolution can both be reconciled through neutral evolution, which allows organisms to gradually “evolve” their genetic background without actually changing all the time. Although their phenotypes stay the same, the underlying genotype keeps evolving. These eI don’t know what evidence you are referring to, but, as an evolutionary biologist, it wouldn’t surprise me all that much. Evolution can be relatively fast when the selection pressure is very high. If the ancestor of whales (some hoofed animal if I recall correctly) were to be forced to quickly adapt to a water-based environment (maybe their originThis is indeed a difficult issue. Convergent evolution makes species superficially very similar, making it hard to know whether they share recent ancestry or not. 

Note however that this is partially resolved by the principle of competitive exclusion: two very similar species cannot typically coexist, as they compete for similar resources. If one Well. She’s wrong. Here is why:

A belief is a conviction that something is or isn’t the case. When presented with two options (odd or even), it may sound like there’s only 2 beliefs. But that’s never true. There is always +1 option: not being convinced. So, when presented with a proposition, you are either convinced of A, convinced of not A, or yoThat’s not a research article, that is an interview with a professor that was blown out of proportion by the media.

Look, 100 years is not going to do anything with our thumbs. A much more likely effect is that our thumbs grow more sensitive within our lifetime, which is merely your brain learning to making use of tiny differences in tactile inforWell, now you’re just completely losing it. Not only are you cherry picking the good/bad examples to favour your argument, you’re actually arguing in favour of biasing the data to support your thesis. However, even IF we act as though the west became prosperous independent of religion, and the middle east became a hellhole independent of religion, You’re right, it was an assertion without evidence, but you are completely missing my point: I am talking about what happens when you (the child) wouldn’t necessary have believed these things for any other reasons than people telling you. The fact that there’s so many different religions proofs that the details these people tell you aren’t supporteIt’s not an easy subject matter, as biological systems are a lot more complex in terms of behaviour than stars. I recently attended a meeting in precisely this topic, and the general consensus is that predicting short term evolution is becoming more and more feasible, but longer term seems very hard. The analogy that was presented was the weather, Let’s tease apart the two examples you gave, as there is a genuine difference I think.

As a kid, like any other kid, you had good reasons to trust your parents. They know what kills you (snakes and fires), and what keeps you alive (eating your veggies and investing in education). Thus, while human kids are hardwired to trust their parents without It’s not really faith if you know you’re doing it to explore ideas. For example, a handful of mathematicians (approx. 16 century) have explored the idea of the square root of minus one, which is now called i. These people of course knew perfectly well that you cannot take the square root of a negative number (as multiplying two numbers makes a posiYou’re missing an important point in your calculation: biological systems integrate information gradually, and therefore don’t ever need to “discover” the whole gene at once. In fact, if you assume each small step is achievable, then the conditional probability if a gene being formed approaches 1 (given sufficient time).

The real problem is assumiI cannot say I agree on how you defend postmodernism by saying it is “impractical”. If you base the study of medicine in objective truths, you cure people. Vice versa, if you try to base sexism or racism on perception, we end up with the shit-show we have seen for the last couple of centuries. Science rather, made it clear how sexism is irrational.&gt;But there is nothing that to me tastes better than a well seasoned medium rare steak. It's not even close

I hear you. Personally, I try to always do a little better each passing week or month. Here in the Netherlands, popular supermarkets started selling much more sound meat (at least not from the *worst* kind of factory farming). That also isSome replies already pointed out that, yes this is a thing, and it is called niche partitioning. As people already gave you some examples, I would like to complicate thing (as I do).

It is often simply said that species evolve "into" the available niches, therewith "filling the gaps". This is partially true, but it is important to also note how niMany or most have horizontal gene transfer (HGT), although some have fairly limited rates of HGT. It appears that no one species is **entirely** immune to sometimes accidentally picking up some DNA from the environment and integrating that, but note how the odds of this happening are fairly low compared to species that *actively* engage in this proThat is a great question, and it is often very arbitrary. In my specific field (microbial evolution), bacteria are categorised into species simply based on some degree of dissimilarity (usually in the DNA level). Experts in the fields sometimes say we may drop the species concept for bacteria altogether, as it isn’t really useful. Others say that bI am a broken record here: MWI has 0 implications for free will. It doesn’t proof or disproof it. 

Most experts on the topic will even touch upon this, as it is a point many people get wrong: not believing in free will doesn’t imply determinism. Either the universe is determined, and you don’t have free will, or it is partially random (MWI), but iThat is not a demonstration, that is a VERY bald assertion without evidence. There is no evidence that your brain is somehow modifying the entire universe. Instead, everything suggests that our brains are Newtonian machines just like planets and atoms. You cannot think a thought before you think it, therefore, you cannot decide it. 

Look, I’m boreYou define free will as unhindered decision making. I don’t. I’m not interested in debating your version of word, as I am tired of people redefining free will this way. I think most people feel like free will gives them the ability to do two or more things under identical circumstances. That is what Christianity called free will, and that is what II think you’re looking at it from the wrong angle. Try not to think about what is “stopping you”, but rather focus on if you can actually author your decisions. You referenced qm earlier, which is a similar way of missing the point. If you don’t know which version of the many worlds you end up in, where is your freedom of will? You cannot decide beI think I agree with everything you say. Note however, that your example makes it very clear that EP is not a science. Scientists do not only postulate hypotheses, they also test them.

Anyway, you present a good overview of different stages of claims made by EP, scientific or not, and you’re right, it can be insightful. In that regard it is more aWhile there is nothing wrong with the concept that our psyches are a product of evolution, I am genuinely concerned with evolutionary psychology as a research field. My problem is that this field cannot really test it’s own hypotheses. If colours make us feel a certain way because of psychology, how on Earth will you test that this is an **evolved*Sure, but was it ever going to be a credible science anyway? How are we ever going to verify statements like “we evolved to be calmed by the blue sky, which is an indicator of good weather”? I can make all this up, but HOW can this be scientific? How do we empirically test it?

We can test the psychology part, but not the evolution part. PsychologyI again disagree, I think it is in fact wrong to say we “evolved from apes”, because by saying so you fail to make the distinction between our ancestors and modern day apes. It is a terrible sentence, and I would once again ask you to stop using (or defending!) it. Of course, it’s mostly a matter of perspective, but clarity is paramount. Don’t say All you are doing is causing the OP more confusion. We COULD call our ancestors apes and monkeys, but then we have no way of distinction between our grandfathers and our nephews. “Family” is too vague a term, and so is “ape”. We grow up with our nephews, and I argue that this is what we should call “ape”. 

Look, you are strictly speaking correct, We have many experiments in which microbes, plants, or insects evolve. They get new features, or change existing features. Some people find this unconvincing as the selection is not “natural” enough. 

In more natural circumstances, we have taken dna from soils on a regular basis, and we see how microbes / fungi adapt to e.g. human caused pollutionIt’s not so much us evolving **from** apes, we evolved **with** them. They became chimps, gorilla’s and bonobos, while we became humans. And for all of these species, different ancestral fossils exist. (With a strong human bias because we like ourselves more ;p)

In other words, the premise of your question was wrong. It’s not as though we have a lI think you misunderstood what scientists mean with natural. It is not some fixed concept with boundaries in which we dogmatically do our work. It is simply all that is demonstrated to be true. In this light the entire concept of “supernatural“ makes no sense, as all supernatural things for which we have a demonstration would simply be called naturNo, it is not because the criticism is in any way sound nor valid. It is because it freaks certain people out. If evolution is true, which it is, then almost all religions have been looking at the world through the wrong lens. Because of Darwin, there are no longer any ways to rationalise beliefs in a creator, and people very quickly feel their morSure, you can find some links below.
