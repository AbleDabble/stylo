That was in the rewrite I put out on here:

[The Last Jedi Basic Outline Re-Do](url)

&gt;**I don't particularly hate TLJ, but I think the movie is not well done, to me, and I think I had different references for. I think they could've stood to have Rey be Luke's daughter and structure a story about the burden of legacy in TLJ. Lord willing, these To me, Gotham is a bad place to live. Not because of racism, but because it's a bad place. It's like trying to say the Joker's evil because he abuses women. The Joker's not evil because he abuses women, he's evil and abuses women, as he is evil, though he also abuses others.

Or Lex is evil because he's racist against aliens. To me, I prefer Lex isI didn't find the 2nd arc that interesting.

I didn't find the villains that interesting. Wanting to live, to me, has been done on this show and, personally, I don't like it as a motive. And the revenge thing for Eva, to me, is stretched out, without her really doing much as a villain.

I though the world building wasn't that interesting and didn'tI didn't say he got them. But whether he learned how to use them, he gets them, to me (and maybe some others), I don't have a lot of interest in the difference. I think, to me, it doesn't work. That kid didn't learn how to do that. He heard a story about someone using powers and could do it himself. I don't like that.

I think Luke, in the fiction I personally don't like these things. Doesn't the scene have a kid use powers after that? What's the scene about, if not that?

Luke basically chose not to kill his dad and get rescued by his dad. He didn't help defeat the Empire and the Emperor. Anakin killed the Emperor. The death star would've been blown up, with Palpatine, with or without Luke My opinion: I think it's dumb to have a kid use powers just based on hearing a story about it. I think it's dumb to have Luke be held up as that important, after he did nothing for years and left friends and family to suffer in the midst of what he may have seen as his mistake. While I'm at it, I think it's dumb for everyone to hail Luke as the greI prefer telling different types of stories, with parallels to previous trilogies. I think the ST didn't do this.

In some cases, I can lean into similar types of characters, but I prefer for them to have other different types of characters among them as well. The PT doesn't pair Anakin with a smooth roguish pirate and his alien hairy buddy. It paiIn more recent watches I've interpreted that as him just being sad. The whole movie is after his son, he's like Liam Neeson in Taken trying to get his daughter, and anyone who gets in his way or messes that up, he gets angry and kills (not a 1:1 comparison of course), but when he gets him and his son rejects him, he's sad and alone, and just leavesIn the episode, it's not the character being forced by outside situations to not help Barry. I think I remember the show even frames it as a character based choice. By that perspective, does any choice any character on this show make, really matter, and not be for the plot?

Did she scold her? I think I remember her being accommodating to Killer FrIt may be a sequel, but that sequel is also a sequel to something some may see as having a direct ending, so I think a new story being put out may not be seen by some as out of the question.

I don't think, to me, that movie did a lot different/subverting. But I think, to me, it's not much of a defense in what I'm saying, more a time issue, to me, Rey's Luke's daughter that he had with Palpatine's daughter, Mara Jade. Add further backstory to Luke, from TLJ, explaining that the Knights Of Ren killed her trying to get to Rey and Luke gave her to people as a baby, who sold her to hide her, as they were chased by jedi hunters or whatever, and that he became bitter as a result of this, after disIris had feelings for Barry before that.

Linda asked Iris questions, that Iris told the situation as I think she saw it. She even didn't answer like that at first, and did after Linda pushed. Barry lied to Linda.

She didn't twist the advice. She took it and pointed out Barry's problems with not listening to others, which did happen and did nearlyWas her intention to date really because she was thirsty and didn't care he was grieving? Or was it her trying to offer some comfort to him?

Iris isn't obligated to take Caitlin's advice, but she took that advice either way.

Iris didn't say that she didn't care Eobard killed his mom. Barry asked her if it doesn't bother her that Nora was working Superman is a popular identity that Clark has to protect his normal life as Clark Kent. In Superman structure, someone may look for that for someone to pin that identity on. In Smallville, specifically at this point, Clark doesn't have that popular identity, and, as far as he knows, no one dangerous is looking for that identity to pin on someone. BI don't think it would've been in character for Lana at that point to do that. I think, at the time, the character was one to dig into someone's life like that when they didn't want it.
I think, in season 6, she's at a place character wise where she would do that, and she does do that.

That's an assumption. In season 2, let's say after she begins Lana saw Clark help her in the tornado. That's about her life. Clark gets hopped up on red k, asks her out, then tries getting with another girl. She asks why and asks if he was being honest, not knowing about the situation. He doesn't give her an answer. He tries again, tells her Chloe's sick, that gets refuted as far as she thinks at the time, ge5-6: I don't agree with that in any way. In those season's I think it was showcases that she reasonings like depression, obsession over the aliens that came in the ship and such.

In season 6 I think, to me, she's mostly there to react to things and doesn't take a more revenge driven turn until later in the season.

season 7: It's not their job to I think if Lex was like that, then, he'd have done things like kill the guy who hurt Helen, kill Helen, tried to get at Clark before he'd been able to prove Clark's powers (i think the show developed that Lex was heavily suspicious that Clark had powers), wouldn't have pushed back against Nixon in investigating the Kents, he wouldn't have done any That doesn't negate Barry's emotional connection to him. There's no proof Barry would've gone down a dark path without Joe.

Barry's dad was still someone he could talk to, so he didn't lose them both, to him.

What does love or a loss of it have to do with Thawne in the situation, if he's a psychopath?

Snart killed a civilian in his first episode&gt;Iris killing savitar with a gun- need I say more?

Why? Joe killed Rival with a gun in the premiere. And I think Iris doing it played nicely with what I think a thematic concept was, that no matter what Barry did with his powers, he actually didn't accoplish beating Savitar. HR the normal human undid his first plan, Barry's real victory came wh&gt;Iris killing savitar with a gun- need I say more?

He maintained that connection with his dad.

Barry had a dad he still cared about and cared about him, that he still saw as someone who wasn't what Joe thought of him as.

Barry didn't lose both his pI disagreed about Devoe.

Joe's a dad figure, but Barry already had a dad. Joe looked after him, but he didn't offer him anything, in an emotional connection level, Barry didn't already have. This doesn't dismiss Joe helping Barry.

Snart was a villain. What does that have to do with things? That tells me that version of Barry made the wrong choiceI disagree with that concept.

Barry isn't shown to get anything from Joe specifically, that helps him, in show. His friend, Iris, shows him the big gesture of comfort.

Thawne kinda said he looks at Cisco as a son. And he was still a villain and still was willing to kill him. Why does Barry seeing Joe as a dad make him family, and more important tI don't agree the idea that his body being damaged like that, is him losing love.

I think the show, as far as I remember someone saying, addressed the idea that Barry had issues with Joe growing up. In the Pilot Barry expresses his resentment towards him, for dismissing his claims of innocence for his dad. How is Joe different than friends? He's nAnd the others had people in their life as well. Like Devoe with Marlize.

Devoe didn't lose his family. He had Marlize. If friends aren't the same, how does that relate to Barry, who had basically friends in his situations? Joe isn't his family. I think, in the show, as far as I remember seeing someone post, that Barry didn't have a positive relatBarry lost his family members. That didn't make him a villain. He had his friend and mentor in Iris and Joe, and later in life, the team.

They all had or got people that cared about them, that they cared about. I think it's not so much not having those things, but people not regarding what they have or could have in life. Thawne was, as far as I tDo things actually change who the character is, instead of what they are?

Iris began going back to her journalism thing before the end of season 4, after season 3 had her doing it in parts. Though all those scientists, before that, were shown to have poor decision making abilities.

The show has dumbed down Barry to make other characters seem releSome of the first things Barry does in these shows is be nerdy and fanboy over the Arrow.

I'd prefer these shows be consistent in writing this character. Otherwise, the issue is more that they've written him in ways that may not be consistent, to you, with the post crisis version of the character, since the beginning of this version of the charact**I have no real problems with this season. Yeah, there were disappointments, to me, but nothing huge, to me. Here are the ideas that God, if He wills, blessed me with:**

**THE WRATH OF SAVITAR:** Same. But the philosophers stone is spit out of the speedforce after Wally's sucked in. The stone is now inert. They give it to ARGUS.

**INTO T**PART 3:**

**FINISH LINE:** Barry is driven by rage and grief to destroy Savibar by any means. He lashes out at the team, blaming them for accepting his weakness to not do what he now thinks is necessary. His mom, dad and now Iris are all dead because of that weakness. Joe tries to calm him by telling him that Iris wanted him to move forward, givTitle: Not particularly.

Content: Iris had a thing for him before she found out about the future and the E-2 thing. Why would not buying their romance equal hating her? But also, Barry does a lot of not smart stuff.

Iris' life had been threatened by Reverse Flash. Her mentor had been killed by him. Eddie didn't need to know, anymore than she did,&gt;!Based on what the show has the doctor, if I remember correctly, say about Thea's situation, that tells me death. If the show says otherwise at some point, I think not good writing. I stick with what I think the initial story, as developed, had said.!&lt;

&gt;!Oliver wouldn't know if Thea showed signs. He wasn't there. He put her at risk putti&gt;!Based on the structures the show developed, I think she was dead. But either way, it was wrong.!&lt;

&gt;!Oliver's mistakes have endangered the lives of others before, and it did here. He allowed Thea to roam in the city and did nothing to help or tell her about the situation she was in. She did it without knowing much about the pit, like OliI didn't say they specifically listened to those fans. But that comment was replying to blackstar_22's statement about the writers taking notice of what fans think of the character. I think they weren't doing something right.

I don't like Oliver, so, there was a point where it wasn't a picnic for me. lol. I think the majority of Felicity's vulneraI don't like Felicity, but I also don't like Oliver, moreso than her, and don't want that character with any of the main characters particularly, in a romantic capacity. I may not like Felicity and may think she's had a hand in some of the issues I have with the show, as it is, but I also think the writers are the ones who wrote it that way, and a I would theorize that, for whatever issues, some may have in regards to season 6 NTA actions, that some may not see their issues with them as persistent and long lasting as some may have with Felicity.

If what you're bringing up there is the Diggle being the GA thing or something, I think it's not impossible to suggest a similar perception as the &gt;!Thea wasn't dead, until she was unhooked from life support, flown to apparently another country, rolled into the desert and prepared for her situation, by which, as far as the parimeters the show sets, she would be dead, in show. There's no strong difference.!&lt;

&gt;!Oliver still did it. No justification on either side. Both were wrong. AndI don't. I don't like, basically, all of that. Except the Merlyn and Moira stuff. That's something I can see more.

But I don't think they have villified them as the source of it all. Look at the team arrow vs new team arrow conflict. I don't remember Felicity getting much flack in regards to that.

I think Felicity's blamed for a lot of it, but moI may not totally agree with the other shows examples, but, I do think it's an odd thing for Kara. I mean, what exactly happened there? If they were doing a thing like the Justice League the animated series episode "A Better World", &gt;!where there was a universe where heroic characters had taken a dark turn and become dictators, after Lex had bec&gt;Felicity did not break up with Ray to go sleep with Oliver. He broke up with her because he realised she didn't love him and she did love Oliver. It was actually a pretty decent scene for them. The timing of her then sleeping with Oliver isn't great by any standard, but is is a couple of days and it's dictated by plot (as everything on Arrow isThe writers listening to fans in regards to them influencing the writing of the character like that, to me, is on the writers.

Barry crying about his mom and her death and such is different than someone crying about boyfriend and melodrama. I take the rest over the whole actions of Oliver and Felicity.

I think her vulnerability is mainly cheap me&gt;!Not much different than Oliver unhooking Thea from life support, bringing her back with the pit despite the warnings, leaving Thea in that situation of violence and fighting and not warning her about the issues for months as he lived a surburban life, and then got onto Laurel about keeping secrets, after he gave the man who organized her sisteSEES TITLE: Sure.

SEES CONTENT: Oh. I don't think in that way for this situation, necessarily, depending. Joe is a cop and, presumably kills in defense.

The Oliver thing, I think, to me, is a conflicting idea of what the shows want vs the reality: They want Barry/Oliver to be friends, but the reality is Barry and Oliver are more opposed to eachotMack didn't have much of a relationship with Deke. It's not like that, where him and Daisy were partners and she had that team in that timeline with her, as she was endangering her own life and doing it with Yoyo in the process. I think Mack was actually fairly casual with Fitz after his situation, which I think was different as well, to me, my intHis attempt to stop it was nonsense and wrong.

This doesn't answer why he would do nothing and let them die? To me this is all things the movie did to excuse the actions of the character.

I don't buy him legit considering to kill Ben. I don't buy him abandoning his friends and family to suffer and doing nothing when asked for help.

These things,That's an interesting idea. I like that. The funny thing is that I think, in a lot of cases, using evil dopplegangers are can be used in interesting ways, to say something about the present characters we have. But I think them just being evil nazis doesn't say much of anything. I think it may have more tried with Kara and Overgirl, but I think therI don't think Reverse Flash was doing anything other than being a villain in that situation. I don't think I remember him having interest in nazi stuff.

But I don't see the point in doing the nazi thing at all. Couldn't it have been just evil versions or like the episode of Justice League the animated series "A Better World"? Did they do it just tThat didn't happen. Laurel specifically, to Oliver, trashed herself for prosecuting Moira, her job, even though I think she tried to cut her a deal to avoid the death penalty.

Laurel held anger at the Hood for a couple episodes or so and then blamed herself for Tommy's death. I don't remember for sure, but I think Oliver saw her do that.

That wasI didn't say it was lessened. I said I don't think I had to say they were wrong for it.

I'm taking issue with suggested violence. Not with those people not being supported or not liked for what they did. Call me weird, I view talking about feeding someone into a woodchipper more of a horror.

She could also win her first pulitzer beca**Here are the ideas God blessed me with:**

**PART ONE:**

And in the middle of it all: Jor-El, Lara and their baby, Kal-El. Trying to escape.

They reach the hangar kryptonian ships.

Lara asks if there's anything they can do for everyone else.

JI think basing romances in chemistry and not story and character consistency, I think doesn't make something, to me, strongly written.

Did the show go downhill? I don't even like Barry and Iris that much, but I wouldn't say that. And, considering, I don't think Barry and Iris being together effected the plot as a whole, I think them being togetherI don't defend the Patty character, but I think the context of the issues is different:

1. With or without what's going on in the world, Patty essentially taking revenge, and the way she tries to do it, is wrong.

2. I think it's never explained, as far as I remember, whether or not the public and/or police know that the Wells they knew had powersI think this also shows a similarity to something that Iris does later:

She rejects abandoning Nora, her daughter, someone she cares about, even though she did the wrong things in lying about Thawne.

Unlike Barry, who didn't see past his anger and pain, and see his daughter as someone who wanted to save her dad, even if that meant working with ThI'm not suggesting that Laurel was a perfect person or a perfect adaption.

But, to me, I think that's a kinda equivalent of the differences between Snyder Batman and Nolan Batman. Nolan Batman has killed, but that's not a major thing the character did, a lot, with active intention. While I think that applies to Snyder Batman. Laurel has killed (thJoe is a cop. He's killed people, I think, he thinks are active physical threats at the time.

Atom Smasher and Sand Demon are the ones I think that more applies to. Though I'm not 100% certain how intentional they url particle accelerator meta prisoners in season 1 had already been beaten and, I think, in theory, weren't able to do anything. At thI think Griffin Grey punched Barry, knowing it would effect him negatively.

Savitar is a future time remnant version of Barry. As far as HR, Clarris and the officers goes, this Barry, in this timeline, hasn't done that.

Atom Smasher and Sand Demon are the ones I think that more applies to. Though I'm not 100% certain how intentional they were.
