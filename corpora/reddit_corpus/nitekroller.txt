With my beliefs right now, there is nothing after death. I die, blood stops pumping, oxygen doesn't reach my brain, all neurological functions cease to function. Once that happens, conciousness can no longer exist. It is nothing. You can't even imagine nothing because the very act of attempting to visualize nothingness in your head is something. ThOh my goodness. One day at work I was grabbing a ladder out of my truck to bring to a customer's home, and their child of probably ~9 years old followed me to my truck. Next thing I know he is reaching for the other end of the ladder to help.. Took like 5 minutes to walk with this ladder to the location where as it would have taken 30 seconds by myYea Bernie is independent but he votes Democrat and shares a lot of views with Democrats. I mean he is literally a independent Democrat. He just doesn't associate with the party officially. Why are you so fucking defensive about this? You said yourself that he is very left. 

I also never said he would have a better chance then Biden. Like not onceAt first, &gt;I was definitely biased towards Ellie, and totally not empathizing with Abby, but as I played with her I did a complete 360. At the end I was completely convinced that Ellie was really the bad guy, and her going to kill Abby for a second time obviously wasn't going to bring her peace. Abby is an *amazing character* with an incredible The difference is power output. Microwave ovens for example, operate at the frequency of ~2.4 GHz at 1000+ watts. All of that is transferred into whatever you are heating up. Guess what else operates at about 2.4 GHz? That's right, your WiFi router. Except with this, the router only outputs like 5 watts. Same frequency, different uses. 

So yes, ifI hate budget phones to be honest. Like I understand the market for it, and I'm glad it's an option for some people, but the cheaper phones are basically unusable for me. The faster the better to be honest. I've used, and currently use, a cheap Samsung a10 or something for work and it's horrible. To be fair my most used electronic is my phone, and Yes I'm absolutely fucking loving the game..not sure what why or how people are trashing it. They didn't just barely improve gameplay from the first one, they literally overhauled the physics engine, animations, and gameplay mechanics. The game *obviously* is similar to the first one in some aspects when playing, uuuuh but it's a fucking sequel.. WYears ago, I never had much of an opinion on guns, if you're against them, sure, if you want to own them, sure. I slowly became liberal in recent years, and I suppose my views on guns naturally shifted towards negative as, from what I have experienced most liberals are against guns. 

I live in northern Alberta made up of predominantly conservativeOne video? Really? There are hundreds, if not thousands of videos that depict a middle aged woman that act horrendously to; minimum wage workers, servers, other people etc. With NO reason. Obviously middle aged women aren't the only ones who do this, but the evidence seems to point that most are.

And what they are doing are not just a "tiny momentI think some differing opinions is fine, a good thing even. At some point though, if you have vastly different views to your partner, tension will inevitably arise, and you will never be able to come to an agreement. I think this would cause way more stress than it's worth. Personally, I'm attracted to my S/O because of how similar our views are, aSo having addiction, a chronic disease, labels someone as being a piece of shit human? You're dehumanizing people who are struggling with addiction. It doesn't  matter though does it? Chauvin didn't know George Floyd's past, and he had him under control. He died. He literally took away someone's life and you are justifying it because he was high onYou know, where I live in northern alberta, there are a lot of rural communities which are easily 20-30 minutes outside of the small(ish) city. It gets well below -30 for big parts of the winter, and snow for at least half the year. People are more than happy to live out there in rural areas, and in fact prefer it, and those places are a fraction oUuh, you really think all it takes to get rich is just to have better financial habits? What about someone making 30k-40k a year? How the fuck are they supposed to become rich? Or what about people who were born without many opportunities?

Like if he can do everything that every other superhero has, than I really don't see a point in having all the other heroes. He needs to excel at some things, and be not so good as otherI still think like this at times. I've just recently come to realize my greatest fear is nothingness, the unknown. When I die, I believe that my brain will no longer get oxygenated blood, neurons will stop firing, and with that my consciousness ceasing to exist. I will no longer be anything. I will be nothing. How can that be? It's so fucking up toThis is so wild. This post and your comments have made me realize I'm exactly like you. I have always had troubles describing things. I just assumed that's how everybody's experience was like. I've also always struggled picturing things in my mind when say, reading a book. Maybe that's why I've always preferred watching a movie regardless of how muIn my opinion, the stakes are not very high with any of these questions.

1. $10 is the equivalent of a lunch, not losing much by having a somewhat decent chance to get $90

2. Once again, not getting $20 isn't a big deal. It would be silly of me not to risk it to get $1000. This one is even easier than question 1 I think

3. Stakes are a little hiThe only thing I've noticed, (not that I've been here a decade or anything, but still quite a while) is that there are more people. It has become much more mainstream than it was previously and that brings a lot of people from Facebook, Instagram, etc. Then you get subreddits like /r/funny and it's basically just become a place filled with shitty, I thought the second season was worse. Some of the characters became even more flat and predictable, along with the plot. I found myself barely being able to make it through the last episodes. If you like space exploration sci-fi shows then watch the expanse. I actually think it's my new favourite show. The first few episodes are a bit slow, but onHonestly, I have the exact same reaction as soon as I hear anyone talking about God and their religion. I think a lot of it, for me anyways, stems from a family friend we have that are extraordinarily religious. It's to the point where their child has tried to open up to them about being gay a few times, and they shut her down. They even go as far What do you even mean different symptoms? Sunburn is pretty universal in symptoms. Darker skin has more melanin, melanin absorbs uv light, thus protecting your skin from damage. I never once said people with darker skin don't need sun screen, but they most definitely are at a lower risk of sun burn and melanoma. There are significantly less cases oNone of this has anything to do with technology or social media, and has everything to do with parenting. This is extraordinarily simple to fix; Don't give your child access to these things until you are confident they are mature enough to make the right decisions, and to not be swayed by things they see. Teach your kids critical thinking skills. DOk I get that people like different styles of trucks and cars, some people like massive lifted trucks with oversized tires and some people like their cars literally scrapping on the ground with 45Â° of camber. To an extent I understand why people may like these wildly different stances, and everything in between.. but this truck. My. Fucking. God. TWell how about for starters, being in love or attracted to a 10 year old or a dog is disgusting and is wrong, while being attracted to someone of the same gender is completely ok. The major (but not only) difference here is that a homosexual couple are two individuals willing and able to give consent, while a 10 year old and a dog don't even come c1. Humans would easily be ok if everyone was gay. Reproduction would continue because of modern technology
2. Where the hell are you getting that everyone is going to be gay? Like where the actual fuck could you ever reasonably come up with that shitty point? Relatively speaking, there are very few homosexual people in the world, since genetically No you can have sex when youre like 14. "Age of consent" is when you turn 16 and you are able to consent to having sex with anyone above your age. At 15 I believe you can have sex with someone three years older, and at 14 you can have sex with someone two years older. Don't quote me on this but I'm 99% it's atleast very close to those lines, and I'And then even further, you can buy the toner cartridges on Amazon for so much cheaper, and you shouldn't have many issues with third party cartridges with a laser printer. Like literally I'm looking now and you can get a set of 4 of the brother 221 (used with the 9340) for like 30 bucks. The 500+ good reviews suggest that they work just fine, and wI'm not going to sit and argue about police brutality, and which race is worse to which. But you don't know the story here at all. I mean by the looks of it you could argue that they are releasing the guy. You're making huge generalizations based on stereotypes about the cops that were only doing there job on a random clip on the internet, which caWhen the hell did we domesticate lions? And if you're referring to domesticated house cats then I'm not sure your point. I do not understand the correlation that declawing any cat would have with domesticating cats. There is nothing inherently wrong with domesticating any animal. I mean sure we are exploiting natural evolution, but it is never harmMan reading all these stories about employers and bosses not giving a shit about their employees is very saddening. I'm in Canada and I have **never** experienced anything like this. My managers have always cared about my, and others well being. 

I mean a couple months ago one of my supervisors was having a really tough time at home and my GM gaveNo, it was more of a figure of speech. Not at all did I mean you can't have fun without shaking your ass. You can have fun with.. well whatever you find fun. 

The point of my comment is that the lady in the video was just having some fun, and if that's what she wants to do, as long as it's not hurting anyone (which it most definitely was not btw) I don't know how this happens..? Like I do pay attention when I'm driving lmao. Generally before I go on a commute/trip I don't know I will look briefly at the map and know the roads I'm turning on before I even start. I can confidently say that only after the first or *maybe* the second time I can go to these places without a map most times. 

EveWait wait wait. I'm not a depressed person at all, in fact I'm a very happy person(not trying to discredit what everyone here is going through) but I have always had a **really** hard time waking up. It's probably the most uncomfortable thing I do throughout the entire day. I mean I don't even like sleeping that much, it's just my body fucking hateYes, indeed it has. In fact, the earth is actually quite resilient with all things considered. The earth will be fine, and plenty of species will survive, and likely even us. The point that everyone is making, is man-made global warming is happening at massively quicker rates than anything in history, and *will* lead to a mass extinction event. It See this is why the idea of a multiverse scares me. I mean, the fact that in another universe, everyone could be alive or whatever, kind of just discredits everything that we have focused on. Like why are we even focused on this universe, if there is an infinite amount of others. 

I don't know it just seems like a "cop out" I suppose. And yes I knWhy is it that I watched all of the new Doctor Who seasons up to Peter Capaldi when I was a bit younger, but can literally remember only a small handful of episodes/moments lol. This scene doesn't look familiar **at all** and the same goes for many other ones. Maybe I was just too young to understand or appreciate the show, but it just boggles my mWait.. did you just say plastic is green??

There is **plenty** wrong with plastics. I don't even know how you could ever come to a conclusion like that. I mean obviously the main reason would be that it takes a millennium for it to be broken down, along with millions of tons of micro-plastics in our and atmosphere, along with animals swallowing anWait did you just claim that most men being a hebephile (as in being attracted to a child prior/during puberty) could actually be true? You realize that is generally between the ages of 10-14 right?

I really hope you're just using the wrong word here, and actually mean more like 16+(and even that would be **really** pushing it to claim that most mWell actually without shaving it there is a stupid amount of hair, and I personally fucking hate it. I kind of Just shave all of my pubes, and it's become quite easy to do it. You can kind of put your one leg up and there is tons of access! 

I mean this whole thing is completely preference, and one should not be judged whether they shave down therEveryone needs to put "I was kidding" after every joke now? Lmao. Imagine if everytime a comedian made a joke, they had to say "oh guys just so you know I was just kidding about that" to make sure everyone knew

Obviously different circumstances, and the op probably is not a comedian, but my point would be you should be able to discern between a joWell our eyes are not taking photos, and we do not see in images played at a specific or maximum framerate. In layman's terms, light is either emitted from an object or reflected off one and travels into our eye balls. It is then perceived and translated into an "image" by our brains. It is a constant supply of light, and is in no way individual frOf course you can. You're just so fucking stuck in this stupid notion and are paranoid about a girl hurting you, you don't even try. There are plenty of guys who will cheat you know? 

I find everyone on this sub thinks that men are so much better than women, but people fucking suck in general, whether you're black, white, male or female. It doesn'This is simply a guess, but maybe they were more like different "breeds." Just like a chihuahua can breed with a German Shepard And they look radically different.

Or maybe something similar to caucasian vs African American, but more durastic differences in appearance. 

Also, generally, as soon as an individual cannot breed or pass down genes it wI felt the exact same way about my ex. We broke up and I didn't know if I could love anyone else. Time went on and the more I got thinking about it, the more I realized how much better of a relationship I could have, and that my relationship with her was actually pretty bad(sex life was not terrible, but many other things were). I am now with an abNo expert, but I'm sure it's similar to getting an immunity to a virus for example, you can be immune to one strain and not the next. Just like you can be "immune" to one cat and not the next, since every cat is a bit different genetically, their dander is also going to be different. 

I could be totally wrong, or a bit off, this is just an educateI think the difference there is that laundry detergent are **much** more harsh than dish soaps are, and break down and separate proteins way more effectively than it as well. This means that you don't need the added temperature to help break the proteins down in a washing machine, where you do with dish soap as you can literally just wash your handSo since it is not ionizing radiation, how bad is it really than? (Anecdotal but still relevant) my mom for example, has been tanning and getting sunburns her entire life and she has not gotten skin cancer nor has she wrinkled anymore than others her age. Than there is my grandmother(mom's side) who has done even more tanning and burning, and rarelThat's so incorrect it's not even funny lol. Clitoral stimulation is very important and generally a girl who says it's not is probably just telling that to not make you feel bad. And what do you mean some people don't want to have sex with a woman? Those are very few and far in between and does not make sense to add in this argument, it's irrelevanWell I don't struggle with these things, and I am not going to say I understand it, because I don't know how this feels.. but! Being happy is what makes us want to live. Happiness, whatever that may be for you, is something every single person alive wants and strives for. So why question and doubt that? Everybody has their own way of being happy, iYea I have a second cousin who literally uses an iPad as a means of control. I mean when they come over this 6/7 year old kid is **constantly** on his iPad watching or playing games. He is so preoccupied by the damn thing he barely does anything else. I can see where devices like these can be nice and can actually help children in a variety of waysExactly! The *shit* that comes out of there is just as bad and sometimes can be even worse. And I mean urine is also coming out of there. Like if you can't get over the fact that she defecates out of one hole, than using that same logic you also should not be getting over that she urinates and excretes bodily fluids from the other area. As long as Solution would be using the g703 or the g903 with the wireless charging mouse pad. The mice themselves have amazingly low latency for being wireless, and actually beat a lot of wired ones. that coupled with never having to charge your battery with a cord is awesome. 

Even if you don't want to go with the 03's you can go with the 00's. I have the gShit.. I've always been told I've been too nice and that people are going to walk all over me. After reading this thread maybe it's just that I can't say no. Tonight for example I said yes to an "ex-friend" to help her out with some tech work at her job (NAS drives etc) and I really didn't want to do it. It is my day off and I had other plans that How can someone even fucking believe that? 

I mean I am constantly lying to people who come back with dozens of scratches on their phone despite getting liquid armour applied quite recently. I am so god damn close to just telling my customers the truth, and say that liquid armour does not work and you are way better off spending the same amount onIt is old, it will have problems, mechanically, externally, and internally. It won't be as reliable and is going to be slower.

The answer is 100% yes. Just fucking do it. Those cars are so damn awesome and you will feel amazing driving it. The simple feeling you will have will be out of this world. Everytime you turn that key in the ignition will Wow. I'm in a very similar boat, emotionally wise. Me an my girlfriend love eachother, but we broke up mutually because we wanted to experience other people. I felt like our relationship was going very well, better than ever really, but this whole thing, were are so young and we've only been and known eachother. But what sucks is that, like you, weWell see for me and my ex, (only about a week ago) we broke up mutually and wanted to meet and experience other people. We were pretty much planning for us to get back together in the end.. maybe more of a break, than a break up. But now I just found out she slept with a friend 5 days after our breakup. Like I love her so much, and I want to still I mean. You wouldn't get much. It would be a long process of melting down pennies, and it isn't just the material cost with why they cost more. There's more factors than that. If you were to simply melt down a bunch of pennies and sell the zinc, than you would be getting the amount zinc is worth at the time.  

Right now, zinc is $1.35 per pound, oSure. They don't have a lot of the same **emotional** feelings as we do, or even near the mental capacity, but how the actual fuck can you come to the conclusion that they do not feel pain? That does not make any sense whatsoever. I mean have you ever stepped on a cats tail? Have you ever seen a dog Yelp in pain? Jesus your comment makes zero senseIf they infact do have a later expiration date, than I would assume because there is simply more fluid. This means that bacteria have a larger area to cover to grow and reproduce, thus having a longer period of time to expire it.
