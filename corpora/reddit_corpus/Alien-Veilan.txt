game development is fickle, especially during these times. if there's no release date or timeframe they're giving, it's because they *don't know* when, and it's better not giving a release window and then upsetting fans when it doesn't hit (take a look at cyberpunk 2077) he's just letting us know he's still hard at work.. but i guess that's just noto be frank, it's not just aesthetics! for a 2fa wall, it's a little lackluster in features, like qr code logins, and quicker one-touch logins. not to mention, a fair bit of web pages are broken in the app for some people, and it could really use a good pick-me-up in the quality of life and features department with respects to the store and communii'm having trouble finding it now but.. valve posted a **Looking Forward Into 2020** type thing on the steam blog. they detailed their plans for the year ahead, one of them being to revamp the old chat app (*which the revamp was announced when the big chat update came around*) which would remove chat from the app, instead keeping it focused solely or it's someone that likes the game and wants to buy something for it.

welcome to free-to-play mmo's. it's better than loot boxes!‚Ñ¢Ô∏è


you seem to be confusing 'featured' with 'something that is a feature' though. featured just means that that thing is showing up for everyone and is showcased there on the frontpage. **if something is a top seller,your money can only get *so high* in this game. once it reaches its limit, it hits something called an *integer loop* where, since it can't go up, it just goes *down* and plummets you trillions into the negatives.

if you ever hit this point, it honestly doesn't even matter, because at that point even chests hit a loop- they're all free too open, lall your games are tied to your account. you won't lose them by switching to another pc, but you'll need to download and reinstall them.

saves are different tho. if a game has cloud saves, **you don't need to do anything.** just redownload and go. some games don't have cloud saves though, which you can check by clicking the ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon on the game's lno, i'm referring to (*half-life alyx spoilers*) &gt;!the ending scene, where episode 2's ending was retconned and eli is now alive, with an extra after-credits scene that pretty much screams a sequel in your face. alongside a few interviews talking about future plans for some characters.!&lt;

while valve's yawped about half-life 3 before, it realthey don't let you keep your premium points you got if you refund the game you got those points from.

if your points start running in the negative, they will start removing stickers/backgrounds/whatever else you got with the points, in chronological order, until your points are in the positive.

this is to keep people from buying games and refundino, people take already-existing backgrounds from steam, cut parts of them out and upload them as **Artwork** on their profiles so they can put it on an **Artwork Showcase** to make it *look* like their profile is transparent.

imagine like.. hanging up a painting on the wall, then just cutting a square of your wallpaper off and putting it over theif x is playing ANY GAME WHATSOEVER, y can't play shared games. same the other way around. you can both play YOUR OWN games at the same time though, just not the shared libraries.

being offline can work around this, yes, but i've found it to be spotty at best. 

any progress, achievements, etc. are saved to the account of the person playing the gathere's matchmaking in stick fight, i can't vouch for how active it is but you should get into a game in a few minutes.

stick fight has a bunch of replayability, especially if you find some friends to play it with. it's one of those '*dump half an hour playing*' games, then you drop it and pick it up again another day.

getting over it is just a tit's more like you're using a completely unsupported workaround to run on old versions of software that is expectedly going to eventually not work at all because steam is an online service.

that said: yeah, you can disable the community stuff. there's actually a setting to disable community content. that won't disable content from *friends* thoughhad a match on king's canyon not so long ago, was running up that big gauntlet tower and just.. found a gibraltar crouching next to a door, just waiting, plotting his ambush. i crouched behind him. he knew something was up when he couldn't move backwards, then he turned.

and we locked eyes.

i felt something there. a connection. and i knew he feltsee, thing is, ea and valve signed a **deal** for this. i'm thinking probably valve dropped them a blank check and called it a day for them to bring their games to steam, maybe out of worry that epic would get to ea first, maybe for another reason.

either way, valve wanted this. specifically, they **really** wanted apex on steam from this deal, fri get why you're not the hottest on his stuff because it's of old news/content, but captain d's stuff is less about "*look it's fake!*" and more about "*it's fake, but here's exactly WHY and HOW it was done, with in-depth analysis on the methods they used and, maybe sometimes how you could do similar things yourself!*"

he's someone with a passion skin implies it's purely cosmetic which.. like, what will that *change* for you? it'll just look different in terms of, i guess maybe color? font?

if when he says skin he means making it look more like the old library as an option, like changing placements of ui and buttons and such.. that's still TWO versions to upkeep. current ui, and old-skin uthe thing is, the only way you CAN get a message is if someone is in your friends' list. that's how it works already. the problem is, without the $5 spending requirement, people can just make bots EN MASSE and flood steam with them worse than they already are. the $5 are keeping out so many bots already it isn't even funny.

it's there for a reasonyou couldn't get past that because valve is locking down on old library usage. they're going to be getting rid of that old code eventually, so they're removing ways of actually using it. especially since more and more games require the new library to play.

also, it really depends on where or how those saves were stored. i guess you could.. maybe cto be fair, nowhere in the article, or from anything microsoft  has ever said, was game pass ever hinted at coming to steam. as far as i know, ea access is the very first 'games for a subscription' service to *ever* come to steam, which steam probably hasn't had any kind of support for that kind of thing until now.

so who knows! maybe ms will. buttitanfall 2 is certainly *not* source 2. the only source 2 games are artifact and alyx. it's source. but, that's just me nitpicking. 

that aside, it's been pretty well decided that the source leak hasn't affected *any* source game. the code in titanfall 2's engine has been changed enough that it hasn't hit the game whatsoever. doesn't mean there wi think you're overall being super paranoid over nothing.

hardly anyone gets banned over nothing, and if it's found to be nothing, valve removes the ban.

game bans are just.. i mean, if a dev/pub wants to ban you, you've either done something stupidly wrong or the game was shit enough to begin with you shouldn't have bought it.

play whatever you&gt;i'm clogging up the subreddit with stuff no one wants to see. just ignore me!

*just ignore me* is the most limp-wristed response to.. literally anything dude.

for the past few days, all you've done is beg for games on game giveaway subreddits, which is fine over there, but you don't need to toss this shit around on a game's subreddit just bec- devs don't get paid a penny

- they have a long standing history of horrid, hostile and downright immoral business practices and schemes with consumers

- keys being sold there, just like any other key reseller, has the chance of being stolen thru credit card fraud. those keys have the chance of being disabled by the dev/publisher, meaning you losoundtracks are, by default, in lossless format. it's up to the dev to upload them in that format, but.. no self-respecting dev would upload them in any other quality!

when you download the soundtrack, you can right click/click it and navigate to 'local files' and move the files *anywhere* you want.

the games aren't required to download them. tho&gt;defeat your own argument in the same sentence

what. my argument is that *some* devs/pubs disable family share to prevent that stuff. some of them probably find it easier just ticking a box rather than coding up something to depend on valve's family share system. hard to tell whatever hieroglyphs you're reading from that that.. defeated my argualt account and main account being banned at the same time isn't true for all games- it's how it works for vac and a few other games, sure, but other titles it's not. dark souls being a good example.

all this is obviously a case-by-case basis- not every game functions the same in their banning and online-restriction schemes, thus the removal of fanever said the devs were crying about it. but it's shitty to consumers to suddenly turncoat on a whim for üí≤üí≤üí≤üí≤üí≤üí≤ (*especially if you did a kickstarter. fuck you.*)

console exclusives are a different story entirely. games and consoles thrive depending on what exclusives they have. it's just how they *work,* though i'd really like personally if bothor because epic games is trying to force their way into the market by stuffing cash down developers/publishers throats to make them exclusive to their store for x amount of time. especially egregious when those games were advertised as coming to steam for ages.. only to have their release dates pushed back.

not to mention they're in the bed with twheatley's useless though and his sole purpose in life was to be a literal **tumor.**

don't see much a reason to bring him back since personality cores are a dime-a-dozen down in aperture.

and sending chell the cube was a cute callback to the companion cube from portal 1. the cube chell was given was the one that was incinerated. glados gave it bsharing shouldn't be enabled for all titles.

for competitive games like rainbow six people would use it to circumvent bans, or in gta v, just like they do with dark souls 3, though i know some people family share in ds3 for different reasons.

it shouldn't be enforced, because there's plenty of reasons, some totally sensible, to disable it for youthat music playing wasn't an easter egg, it was just the steam music player opening sometimes because steam just.. decides to do that sometimes.

and that cropped pic is a bug- in the 'game updates' window where it'd usually show ongoing sales and such, instead it would show a random screenshot from a random game.

because

steam just decides to do[read up on this! ](url)

there's grey market sellers- like g2a, and legitimate sellers, like humble bundle.

g2a and other grey markets can have sellers selling keys that've been stolen thru fraud and hijacked credit cards. none of their money goes to the developers. this is because it's live, actual users selling the keys. think ebay. but worse.
randy pitchford is the head of gearbox- the developers behind the borderlands series. he's a genuinely awful person, both in the things he's said and done. 

[peek over this! ](url)

that was all 3 years ago, but since then, he's done, but not limited to:

physically assault the VA behind claptrap.

lied on stage about the monetization scheme behinobviously leaking the source code's going to have security concerns. there's going to be more hackers for sure, but on top of that, some pretty heavy exploits, especially for tf2, that will affect the user directly will stir up.

basically, you should be more worried about playing tf2 than cs:go, since cs:go's seen much more changes to its code and&gt;considering they offer practically nothing besides being a monopoly

you literally have zero clue what you're talking about with that comment alone dude. what steam offers to developers and users, that cut is fair, and is also the industry standard. literally every single store- online and in person- charges that cut. save for epic, who only diswitch runs the game worse.

ps4 runs the game better.

switch currently has the bug of old saves not unlocking things, but if you get it on switch, it wouldn't affect you since you're new. still good to mention otherwise.

all consoles are a single major update behind- currently, consoles only have the new void fields and acrid, while pc has artifamazon isn't getting any slack either. people know about the scummy shit on their backdoor. but it isn't near to the level of facebook's fuckery. and amazon's done some genuinely useful, innovative stuff.

not to mention with twitch: it's hated as a platform, especially for its admin team, but there's no real substitute to it so far for everything play as rex

do a drizzle run

go to the lunar shop on stage 3 (or just hope you get abyssal depths)

donate 3 coins into the abyssal depths map

go to the lunar shop on stage 5 (or just hope you get titanic plains)

donate 3 coins into the titanic plains map

either walk the crabs off, or push them off with your boost

with some patience and a dozsome things to do in the future:

whenever you're getting ready to login because a website is asking for some kind of connection to steam, your best bet is to either just NOT do it to be extra safe, or to look at the url bar.  [url](url) you can see there's a little üîí next to the url but more importantly, the url is spelled [**url](url) as long with loader and her grapple, i guess it's mostly about understanding how her movement works when grappling. if you can angle her right, and get a good feel of her grip, you can whip from one end of the map to the other, or fling yourself spot on right at an enemy.

a lot of crowbars helps give her massive slaughtering damage with the chargepunch. tsometimes when you buy a key on grey market key websites (sites where the gamekeys are sold by people. think ebay for digital games.) they can turn out to be obtained thru fraud. stolen credit cards mostly. if the developer chooses, the keys that're fraudulent can be revoked, and removed from someone's library at any time. could be today, tomorrow,no you don't, what you need to do is not listen to everything some internet stranger tells you to do. why the fuck would a valve employee contact you over DISCORD and not over steam support?

you should have received some emails from steam concerning password changes and other similar stuff, follow those to lock your account and get into **ACTUAL**nope, here's how the scam works:

*hi i accidentally reported you*

*please add* **this person** *who is totally an employee at valve to clear up the situation*

you add them

*hi, i heard there was a report against you*

*to confirm this was a false report, i'll need you to send me your steam inventory so i can confirm none of it was duped*

*i'llthey literally aren't.

they're volunteers and- while they're not expected to outright harrass, beat, maim, mutilate, flog or burn-at-the-stake their users- a mod telling someone to basically 'fuck off' isn't really something to grab pitchforks about, especially when the person making comments/complaints is hilariously entitled.

all sweet, innocenthey already overhauled the chat. they plan on carrying two apps:

steam chat app

and steam community(?) app

steam chat you can download right now, much better version of the chat. the steam app you have right now will be updated some time this year with everything overhauled, like the game communities, store page, groups, authenticator, etc. butyou're making sense, but family share isn't really supposed to be a 'give games to your friends/family for free' type deal. it's for two people on the same computer to share their games. obviously, the 'same computer' thing can be worked around, but it's built in a way to keep it from being abused. **your library is in use, whether he owns the game*makes an edit about downvotes and people not thinking rationally*

*pouts and refuses to talk to a moderator that tried to help because his help wasn't exactly, perfectly what he wanted*


you can't permanently, totally remove a game from your account. try the mod's next-best-choice that you were being *irrational* about before, because that's allsorry but the groups of big dudes is totally wrong. epidemic's big draw is always the big groups so it can spread between enemies, no matter the enemy type. late game, you should have tons of on-hits, so with a big group, you should be able to clear them out zero problem.

epidemic is always good, because of poison, no matter what. the last point oacrid does great with any enemy i think- epidemic defeats any woes about flying enemies because the poison will just bounce between them all, and he does good ranged because his poison spit will deal damage on hit, while also poisoning.

mobbing hordes is easy with epidemic too and a few on hits, even moreso with will o wisps or gasolines.

in othey'know, it's hard to say really! i think his new skills have the **potential** to be real lethal. rather than doing always 10% of enemy health, they just do 60% of your damage per tick. the upside is that blight can **stack.** while that doesn't do as great for his epidemic skill, you can get a bunch of backup mags and some shaped glass, and watch sorry, but the hardmode is.. supposed to be hard. 

all of your complaints sound related either to RNG, or you just needing to get better at the game. prioritize certain enemies, aim for bigger (green item) chests, try not to spend too much time per stage, etc. etc.

healing nerf was good imo, because when it had drizzle healing, the only thing youi'd say acrid, or loader.

acrid has the most consistent damage, as his poison will **always** at the **least** deal 10% of an enemy/boss' health in damage. stack a bunch of on-hit items like bleed, ukelele, sticky bomb, and you can hurt.

there's also loader, who, with over 5 crowbars, can reliably almost one-shot most bosses if you charge your pu**Teleporter** - the teleporter has a large dome of orange particles swirling into its center, which is the hint for where it is. sometimes it can be in pretty inconvenient locations though. there's only a few maps where this can get frustrating: abyssal depths, scorched acres, wetland aspect, and i feel like the new map, sky meadows. you eventuallthere's a difference between implementing innovative features popularized by other games in the same genre offering competition, and having some kind of internal rivalry where they hate the other studio/game and want to outdo them in every way possible.

that just sounds toxic. and that's not the work environment you- or anyone at valve- would wantthis isn't hypno. this artist draws hearts in the eyes all the time. this is just how darkness *is*. she's a masochistic pervert that gushes about getting herself wound up and fucked up. people are upvoting because the picture is hot, and the heart eyes can be **interpreted** by people as hypno. 

you're the one that can't grasp the concept of hypn
