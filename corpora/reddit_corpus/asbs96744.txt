It‚Äôs something to consider. We‚Äôve considered the same thing. We have a 985. We have a second dock for ours since we had the intention to finish our basement at some point...right now, it‚Äôs a big, open area with some carpet squares in one corner with a couch, a workout area, and an area where the litter box lives. We tend to have litter scattered, aMost likely that person had general anesthesia or heavy sedation, what they call monitored anesthesia care (saw anesthesia equipment in background).

When I have them move from the stretcher to the OR table I tell them, now comeI have some family like this too. I‚Äôve not been as ‚Äúon the front line‚Äù as my fellow ICU, floor and ER nurses- you are all badasses, by the way (I occasionally encounter cases for procedures). I have taken a sabbatical from FB because I. Just. Can‚Äôt. With the bullshit anymore. It‚Äôs so sad. 

Just wear the stupid mask. Stop being so argumentative, soI know a few folks (golden retriever and German Shepard owners, specifically) who own Roombas and swear by them. We have one, but have a cat. It‚Äôs really amazing how well they do. I ran a test one time, ran my normal bag less vacuum after the Roomba, and barely anything  was in the tank. Before, it would produce a lot of fur and dust on a weekly ruYesterday‚Äôs central vacuum system is today‚Äôs Roomba. Central vacuums were seen as super convenient, as you didn‚Äôt have to fight with cords (just a really heavy bundle of hose initially) but they are quiet since the main system is tucked away usually in the basement or garage and the suction is superb. 

Now we just hit a button on our phones. But, Ours is configured the same way, and used for the same purpose (except we hung a ‚Äúno soliciting‚Äù sign lol...) The closet is only 2 ft wide though...tiny thing. One vacuum, some winter coats and jackets when not being used all of the time. 

I hung some nice heavy duty hook racks for frequently used coats, hats, and whatnot on the wall right next toI really appreciate that! And also, thank you for also wearing masks, for protecting that vulnerable population that you serve, deviating from what was your old norm and tolerating hours of this thing on your face! 

It‚Äôs hard for those who aren‚Äôt used to it to all of a sudden be forced to get used to wearing the masks for hours. But not that hard I work in an OR. We wear 2 masks. 2!!! 

I have lines on my face from how hard the N95 masks dig into our skin. I wear a surgical mask over the N95. This is the current standard for us. 

Those who bitch about the masks get absolutely no sympathy from me. We are in the middle of a pandemic that isn‚Äôt just going to go away.

My ASC is officially closed until further notice. I do that PRN...

My part time IR position is mostGenerally garage doors can lock from the main button in the garage. Makes it where the remotes and code key pads will not open it, in case someone hacked the signal or the code. There are also manual locks on the door or tracks. We utilized these features for when we went out of town. I would lock the garage door when I was by myself overnight. WanIt did finally pop up, many hours later. I honestly didn‚Äôt check until the next day. We usually put the sleep timer on the TV at night, and let it go.

At that point, it was aThis is the exact issue we had as well.

PS Vue figured it out, we also ran it through the AI took Amtrak from St. Louis to Chicago, really enjoyed it. To not have to fight with parking in downtown Chicago, an absolute yes to Amtrak, since it drops you off right in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere or took the L or taxis to where we went. 

My father in law took Amtrak from Arizona to St. Louis. He got to get the full feel ofOR nurse here: we send instructions home with patients that we require them to sign a copy of. We go over them thoroughly, explaining what things to look for that are signs of trouble, with phone numbers to call us or their doctors for questions. Every place I‚Äôve worked at does it the same way.  

So on that note, this patient needs to go to the ERTerminix introduced me to Optigard, it‚Äôs a gel in a syringe that you leave dollops on the ant trail. Kills them all for a while within a day. Unfortunately they just showed up somewhere else a month later. Works great here in the Midwest for the seasonal ants. 

Terminix did succeed with the German cockroach issue. Within a month, gone.

A couple of my friends are very young at heart, yet, my age, so we went trick-or-treating every year. The last time we went we were well into our 20s...luckily we are also shorter in stature. And we had one of our much younger cousins with us too.

I‚Äôm sorry, but if I had an assault rifle, I‚Äôd get the thing destroyed at this point.

I had never seen one that big, and was like, wtf is this tThe extremely rare situation where a patient can hear and feel their procedure but is paralyzed, because the inhalable anesthesia gases weren‚Äôt enough.

My SO was doing a conference call with a pharmacist and his doc; and I hear him (from across the room) quote something he read on Google about his meds.

But one of tConsult a urologist. They can see if you are having issues with properly emptying your bladder, as well as do a proper clean catch of urine during a procedure called a cystoscopy.
