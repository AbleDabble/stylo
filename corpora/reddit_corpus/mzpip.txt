Voting for a third party in a two party system is just plain stupid. 

Can't you remember *anything*? How did all those protest votes for Jill Stein work out for you? 

We have first past the post here in Canada, which sucks, but the grown up thing to do is use your vote well. In Canada it means people vote strategically, trade votes, or vote againThank you for pointing this out. I keep doing so. We're all black, baby! 

And even if you're a fundamentalist who believes the whole Genesis Adam and Eve myth, the Garden of Eden was supposedly located smack in the middle of East Asia somewhere. 

Think the people who inhabited that were blonde and blue-eyed? 

I hasten to add I am *not* a FundameThe New Rule comment "While you're being paid $600 not to work" (not an exact quote). 

No, Bill, you over-privileged, obnoxious, pestiferous yob, that $600 was so that people wouldn't bloody well *starve*.

Bill is sounding more and more like a member of the Freedom Caucus each week.

I brought my SIN card, OHIP card (picture ID), and some mail from my bank that had my name and address on the envelope and letter to the polling station the day of the election.

For those who have the space (backyard, balcony) and inclination, you can build your fur babies a **catio**.

If you google "catio" you can find all kinds from FYI to companies who will design and install.

When you're voting on something like this, it's your *responsibility* to be informed. 

If you are so damn dumb and/or lazy you can't be bothered to learn the facts, then you don't get to cry "Foul!" now. 

I save my sympathies for the ones who voted to remain and who are still being screwed overAs long as you either keep them inside (or in a catio) for their safety (or leash train train them for walks) deaf cats can live full, happy lives. 

Same with blind ones. 

Check out some of Jackson Galaxy's (The Cat Daddy) videos. He's done visits with people who foster special needs kitties and it's amazing. 

BTW, your smol bebby is adorable anHorses and cats are often chums. My dad grew up on a farm in the 1920s and they used draft horses. 

They had one horse, Charlie, who was meaner than the day was long, but the one creature Charlie loved was the barn cat, who used to sleep on Charlie's back. The horse even tolerated the cat "making biscuits", claws and all, on his rump before settliUp here, people have gone to jail for deliberately infecting others with HIV. IIRC, one serial "infector" got convicted of attempted murder. 

So there would definitely be a precedent here in law for someone who **knowingly** has COVID-19 deliberately infecting others.

Try and excuse your bad manners all you like but if you carry on like this in real life you probably end up drinking alone most of the time. 

If you want yo carry on like a Neanderthal that's your affair.  I doI have a friend who attended the University of Toronto and she told me that it was tougher to get into the course she was studying there than it was Harvard. 

She said that on a graduate level, Canadian universities were as good as, if not better, than Ivy League American ones. It was when you got into post-graduate and Ph.D studies that the Ivy LIDGAF. If we had Scheer, who is *more* corrupt, he would be pulling a Mitch McConnell and starving people by cutting CERB payments and doing his level best to privatize healthcare, and not doing SFA about the environment.

That was an oversimplification used by bin Laden. The US has been killing, interfering and propping up dictatorial regimes in the Middle East for generations. 

Everyone points out SaddaWhen we Canadians opted out of your little party in Iraq, we were the worst people in the world, along with the French. Remember that? The initial support for your bloody mess was sky high and don't ever try to say otherwise.

 It allowed the Bush government to pass things like the *Patriot Act*, start DHS and erode your civil liberties. 

Now it'sPlus you guys have statutes of limitations. And still have a lot of places where the whole idea that what goes on in someone's home is no one else's business. 

Or the whole "Christian" patriarchy thing that say the man/husband/father is literally the king in his own home and can do what he likes. Look at Roy Moore in Alabama, fer crying out loud. I cut ties with my family. Not for political reasons. But just because you share a few strands of DNA with someone doesn't mean you are required to tolerate them or their toxicity. 

As for forgiveness, well, you can forgive a rattlesnake for biting you in the ass, but it doesn't mean you have to get back down in the pit with them.

If Justin Trudeau got up and claimed that all the problems indigenous people have in this country were now totally solved thanks to his government there would be nothing left at the podium but a few I live in Canada. We have socialized healthcare. Works fine. Could be better, but it means people don't have to stay in crappy jobs just to keep (sort of) insured.

For whatever reason, I found Why? My country Canada has two official languages. Switzerland, IIRC, has **six**. What scares you about Inclusivity? 

When I go to any public/government building, I usually see a sign listing the languages spoken. It's a long one, and usually includes Mandarin, Italian, Greek, Farsi, Punjabi, German, Ukrainian, Russian and, oh, yeah, French.  ThaI think that Reagan started it, Newt Gingrich and his flat refusal to cooperate with Democrats accelerated it, and Sarah Palin's obvious ignorance and stupidity helped put the finishing touches on it. 

However, that is ignoring the entire southern strategy that began with Nixon, the decades of propaganda that convince people to vote against their Christ, I am just fucking speechless. 

We have an idiot population here in Canada, but fortunately, no leader (not even the wretched Ford or Kenny) have stooped so low as to play political games with people's lives in order to boost their own poll numbers.

From where this *human* (who wields her pen and can **draw**) sits, above the 49th parallel, Trump is responsible for incredible carnage. 130,000 of your fellow citizens dead and all he does is obsess about his popularity.

Shame on you.  Go home and wash your keyboard and don't come out in publiI never thought of Reagan as a good guy. This was the guy who invented the idea of the black welfare queen, who declared ketchup to be a vegetable, who thought Pinochet was a charming fellow, who compared the Contras to the founding fathers, who cozied up to the despicable Falwell and Robertson and opened the door to the "Moral" Majority. Just for It also helps that we have universal healthcare that is not tied to being employed. If you get sick with the virus, you don't have to worry about paying for tests or hospitalization.

Also, the government's first priority was pretty much supporting the unemployed and businesses affected by the pandemic.  The response wasn't perfect and certainly thConsidering that millions of your fellow Americans are sick, unable to work, unable to feed their families, are facing evictions and foreclosures on a massive scale and Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate sit on their plush, overfeed asses and do absolutely nothing about it, it astonishes me that anyone *speaks* to the GOP, let alone vote forMaybe it's just because I've been migraine-y all weekend (thunderstorms and varying barometric pressure play holy merry hell with my head) but I just was bored.

The only thing that stood out for this Canadian is the remark about Rob FA misdemeanor. The result  of this horrific "crime" Is the equivalent of you being thrown in jail with no lawyer, no hearing and no hope of bail for jaywalking.

One of the things I learned is that the straw technology used by disabled folks to move their wheelchairs, etc., was developed from the space race; it was used to help the astronauts control things in their capsule tWhy not?

Pardon the rest of us all to hell if we don't want Washington deciding who runs our country. You guyOf course.
