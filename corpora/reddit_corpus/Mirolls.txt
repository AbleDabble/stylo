My other idea is a pity breaker, the more you spend on a banner the higher the rate up gets increased. This of course counts for all the characters available in the banner's prize pool.

The increased rate ups gets reset back to their original amount after getting a 5* character (this counts for any 5* character you get, not just the featured charaRerolls would be a bit op don't you think? Unless you're planning to have a limit of rerolls you can make per 10 summons or a discounted CS cost for em.

Cuz if it were to be unlimited then I would just reroll until I get the character I want with only spending 1k CS when in reality you rerolled for about 10-15 times. 

That would seriously hurt thAlternate versions of characters do sound cool, but imagine the grind to get them... Oof

I was thinking of alternate Shanie who &gt;!Doesn't meet Aldo so her curse keeps going on and on until she doesn't feel anything and ended up being an assassin who uses her curse on her male targets for easy pickings!&lt;

And Akane where &gt;!Shion dies in frSorry if I'm a burden, I'm having way too much stuff to do and exams aren't really helping with it a bit. Considering tomorrow is one of the hardest (well for me) subjects for me to tackle kinda punches me in the groins...

I'll read the guides once I have free time after studying on topics I don't understand much

Again, sorry if I caused you frusDang kinda a bad week to start Summer 3 since this week is my trials... Meh I'll manage to balance it out

Can someone explain to me how does Summer 3 event work? I sort of get the Imagination point thingy and the BB$Bills but I don't get the Day/Night time thingy.

Maybe I should ask from start so i don't misunderstand anything... Thanks and sorry&gt;heheh just like my Anabel and Bertrand (T3 null, T2 pain, T2 pain, True VC grastas)

Dang, how's the damage?

&gt;how did you get the "Church of" personal flair btw?

Oh you simply ask a mod to make you a custom one, be sure to be nice to them cuz they're good peeps. I didn't intend to have this flair myself since I wanted it to be assigned to &gt;What I wanted to point out wasn't the fact that most of their servants in FGO are usable for endgame, although that is a plus

Yeah I just wanted to point it out :D

&gt;they have increased the amount of SQ available from weekly quests

Yeah the free 3 SQ each week is pretty neat if you can pull a miraculous 1 summon SSR

&gt;the fact that they&gt;Fate Go

You mean Fate/Grand Order? Yeah it's literally hell in there, rate up is a lie and once you've gone through all the Free Quests from the stories, you'll be dried from SQ (their version of CS) for a long time. 

What compensates this is they let you buy a x1 summon ticket (5 per month) AND gives another one every 7 days which is pretty AS Yuna is a support character with a healing turn-end buff while AS Anabel is more like a DPS-Tank that has a Type Resistance turn-end buff.

If you want healing and support then go for AS Yuna, if you want some bulkiness and butt mashing go with AS Anabel.

Also I guess I'll be going for Bria since I already got her 5* tome ready. I'm gonna make Have you atleast started First Knight and the Demon Sword of Prayer? If so;

&gt;!On Uruala there's a girl who sells flowers, buy em and put them on each of the graves on the top side. Then ring the bell, an old man will thank you for doing his job and give you the grasta. The grasta acts like the Protagonist Grasta, except it's when equipped by soI'm still having a crisis between whether to upgrade Bria to 5* (because she looks awesome and Hold Ground is pretty neat) or AS Anabel (cuz I need Water Zone)

Tho I have some doubts, once I get the free Chants I can upgrade Bria almost instantaneously but I'm afraid her usefulness would be minimal outside Hold Ground (but still she looks cool)

AConsidering that &gt;!Lakhesis never found Deirdre and Anabel didn't die, Radias didn't get influenced by Deirdre to become one of the Royal Knights which gives her a vast option of careers to take. Knowing Lakhesis (R.I.P PTL Lakhesis tho) he wants his daughter to be safe so OGTL (Original Timeline) Radias opening an Inn and becoming an Innkeeper 1. What does Deirdre and Anabel like to eat?
2. What kinds of hobbies do they have?
3. Will there ever be more AS for story/side story/chance encounter characters? (the first being Saki)

I already made my questions way earlier but some of them aren't regarding Deirdre and Anabel (sadly)

Oh and will we ever get to see Deirdre's and Anabel's parentAS Renri and AS Akane are one of the top Fire DPS currently so if you're fighting not weak to Fire, they'll kill it for you.

Mikahayahi is the name of Akane's Another Style form, think of Another Style as a 'another version' of your character. It doesn't always mean it's an upgrade tho as sometimes Normal forms and AS forms have diffrent skills whHere's a tip, never **EVER** use Chrono Stones to continue when your frontline's been wiped out. You'll regret it in the future.

You'll get free characters as you play along so don't worry about the lack of characters you have right now, you'll add more to your time-traveling army.

Right now we're having an event where our community calls it 'The1. Will there ever be customizable characters e.g outfit swap?

2. Plans on making Story NPCs into playable ones like &gt;!Suzaku, King Miglance, Thunder King, Vares and the likes!&lt;

3. Since &gt;!Guildna!&lt; was buffed in the JP version are there any plans to buff the other main characters?

4. Will there ever be AS versions for our main charaI searched gamepress on available/unavailable servants on NA and didn't see Avenger Nobu on the unavailable servants list so I assumed she was already released a long time ago (I'm fairly new, just started a few weeks ago so I don't know what happened in the past events but I try to see what events I miss and when they'll get a rerun in the future)In my country we're also given textbooks to use each year, it's up to you whether or not you wanna use it but regarding teachers they almost never use the textbooks except for certain subjects. Tho even if it's free to use we still have time give it back to the school by the end of the year and if you were to lose one you'll have to pay it back fulAh forgot about this, this is going to be my hardest decision to make and my choices are

1. Radius

2. Hardy

3. AS Yuna

4. Kikyo

5. AS Suzette

6. AS Nagi

Radius, AS Yuna and Hardy are for their zones and damage, but I already got m!Anabel for tanking and AS Gariyu for fire zone so this kinda conflicts me. I don't have AS Yuna and I don't know&gt;Myunfa, Cerrine, and AS Nagi. I'm still missing a fourth earth character for it, so Deirdre will fit right in.

That'll be one hell of an Earth Team

&gt;I'm not going to bother farming Deirdre's Shadow because episode dungeons are miserable.

***Masochistic grinders intensifies***

&gt;T3 Earth and T2 Pain x2 or something.

Why x2 T2 Pain and So I just got Skadi from just 1 summon ticket and 30 SQs, I wasn't even planning to get her too but I'm new so a new SSR is good to have :D

I looked at her kit and she looks like a Quick Support Servant, my question is;

1. What kind of ce is best for her?

2. Most of her ascension items are from Babylonia and I'm just starting Septum, should I leI bought my first ever 1k stones pack and I used my 2.6k free ones to try ams get Nagi (which then gave me a 4.5* Shion but I already got his AS and I have 0 Chants) and now I'm sort of feeling troubled. I now only have the 1k paid stones and waiting for an SDE &gt;!that features Chiruriru!&lt; but god knows when one of those would appear in GlobalPretty weird that the SDE is on AF Claude's point (meaning no Myunfa) considering JP is further away from that update. I'm gonna pass on this SDE if it goes the same with Global since I'm hoping for another one that includes the Western Continent Characters (probably months away for Global)

Oh thank god free **and** individual rescinds, no more goSo I tried this and I actually got lost on what to do 

Anabel, Mona, Premaya, Mana in the frontlines then Cerrine and Myunfa at reserves at Turn 1

Anabel uses Guardian Soul, Mona uses Mahasukunda, Premaya uses Tri-impact on Anna, Mana switches with Myunfa. This is Turn 1

Anabel uses Elemental Wall, Mona uses Miracle Punch on Anna, Premaya uses CHaving a bit of trouble handling Anabel's 2nd manifest fight since she heals more than I can deal more damage since my only damage dealer during the first attempt was Premaya. My team composition when I tried it first was Mana and Mona (as buffs/debuffs and heals) with Premaya (as DPS and Physical Res Buff) and Anabel (also as a Physical Res Buff) And make sure the fight is atleast equal and I don't mean like "Oh but men are naturally stronger and larger than woman" type of shit. I meant like if she slaps you, you slap her back. Nothing more, nothing less. I mean if you slapped someone lightly but then they counter with an RKO I'd be pretty pissed off and impressed that they managed to do anReally this place isn't worth it unless you want some Sponges, Sea Lanterns and/or the feeling of accomplishment

This place is called the Ocean Monument guarded by 3 Ancient Guardians who each can give you the Mining Fatigue debuff (where it makes you take a long time to break stuff). As long as they're alive they'll continue giving you that debufI don't think I would be using money since:

a) In my country even the cheapest SQ pack is still expensive

b) I have another game (Another Eden) I'm planning to mainly invest money in since I played it for more than a year and I'm actually addicted to it (hence why I got addicted to other gacha games like F/GO

c) Time isn't really on my side unti&gt;You can leave the "Free Quests" that get unlocked after clearing Main Quest nodes for later, just follow the story and you'll get some SQ that way.

Tho I'm doing fine just finishing them all as I go, I already finished all of Fuyuki City and I'm just entering Orleans.

&gt;Yes, don't burn any of the 1-star/2-star/3-star units until you already&gt;Also remember this, doesn't matter how silly the events are, they are still canon! (Which is actually true, amazingly enough).

Knowing Carnival Phantasm exist I don't I would be doubting about canon.. 


&gt;when you need to level up your servants do the highest Ember daily quests

Oh yeah regarding levels, do Servants not get exp from battlesYeah FEH really only focuses on their main 6 characters rather than the others, there it doesn't matter if it's a 4* or a 3* to dish out damage but only if you're willing to invest in only them which is kinda hard.

Yeah I'm loving the story so far and I'm only on what I presume is Ireland? (the one after Fuyuki City). I really need to start gettinSo it's almost the same... Neat, I don't always find a gacha game that lets all the featured characters in a banner to get their rate up alone as it progresses (I'm looking at you FeH)

On what day do you predict this banner drops for NA servers? And can I actually manage to save enough SQ to get a copy of her if I start saving right now (did 1 x10So I racked up a couple of Servants (Idk how I only did like 1 x10 summon and FP summons). I mostly use Mash and Heracles and bring a random support from other players to actually carry me so I can grind the stuff needed for upgrading/leveling which are available on higher levels.

Should I keep summoning a bit more or should I start saving now sinI got a Berserker : Heracles from the tutorial pull and saw on the wiki that it's one of the top 3 great starters to have so I guess I'll hold on to him for awhile

Really I'm scared to roll anything except Friend Points. Since the cost to roll a x10 summon is a whopping 30 SQ, and I'm barely getting past 10 (even though I would get more as I progr-So I should complete the quest on each mission to get the Saint Quartz right?

-Should I make all the Servants I get to lvl5 Noble Phantasm?

-So do all the Daily Quests that I can do

-Can you give me an example of some of the 4 stars and below Servants which are quite useful?

-Well I only have like 4 Saint Quartz, for now

-So I need diversity I think I just made a deal with a devil. I used to get a ton of treatise drops almost everyday and get 0 Chants until this month (I played since last year). But now for some reason, I'm getting wild Chants here and there but no treatises were to drop. Now I don't mind getting Chants since I have a lot of characters to upgrade but I need 2 more treaEven when the featured character's rate is up (highest is like only 0.80% if you're aiming for their 5*) it's still a shitty rate, almost no difference to a normal banner. 

Fatefuls are great tho but still doesn't guarantee the featured unit and I plan to buy this if my free stones doesn't get me the unit I wanted. Basically if I'm desperate I'll My desired units are Radius and Chiruriru (mainly Chiruriru but I also kind of want Slash Zone but I won't be spending more than 2k on Radius' banner)

Quarantine in my country will end at 24 June so I will be starting to spend money on stones starting that day (I would only be buying the once a month discount stones tho since even without the discHighest I saved was 4k for Myunfa but since I didn't know she was coming I didn't have enough time to save more. I make a thought to myself that "Hey I can get this character in future banners so really there's no need to spend all my stones right now". 

Whenever a banner comes, I check if the featured characters are any of my liking. I skip AS baI see, well I just remembered that I could've just borrowed one of my friend's bees and mate with mine. I only managed to catch 1 after an hour of searching, at first I found 3 but I thought smoking the nest and destroying it won't aggravate the bees....learned that the hard way. i then found 2 more bees just a few blocks away and I used leads thisI mean they already did a collab with a Persona game I just don't know if they would do it again with a diffrent one. 1 or 2 times and it'll be fine but if they do it more and more it would start to look like they're milking the game.

I would be happy for Another Collab with Persona games but it would better if they were to do so with other games So I can upgrade Claude and Isuka (praise be) to their AS forms and planning to because my Wind Team sucks rn (only Mona and m!Azami are doing the damage, Amy and AS Ruina's not doing any good but then again I didn't put any T2s or T3 on AS Ruina)

Tho I have a 4.5* Ewan just wanting to get upgraded to 5* and get his manifest tho that would mean I I remembered when I first tackled Mighty's, he kicked my ass on the first fight then Hismena came along and shot him down.

 Then 2nd fight's ready, thought I could pull it off with the same tactic as before, melt him down with Hismena. Little did I know he managed to ***omaewa mou shindeiru*** me, I gave up on getting his upgraded manifest for a lHow many characters did you invested on? Either in terms of fully grasta, upgraded weapons/armors for them to use , etc

I only have 5 characters who are fully grasta which are AS Akane, Hismena, LaClair, AS Gariyu and m!Azami and I only need 1 more Jadeite to upgrade a T3 for Premaya as my main source of dps on my Earth Team (not until Deirdre andIn my experience, save those stones for future banners because even if they're not in focus you can still have a chance to get them AND the future characters in their banners. Unless you really need those two like right now for something like a boss fight then 1 or 2 pulls wouldn't hurt (only hurts the soul tho)

I'm f2p myself but I regret pullingI had a Power of Null (Katana) available for trading just now, I had 49 trash......... And 0 Jadeites after upgrading 5 T3s..... But I got my first wild Chant Script from AD Garulea so that's something

And thanks for the recommendation will try to replicate it to make my AS Shion great (and as preparation to kick &gt;!Ogren Zennon's Shadow's!&lt; Unnecessary violence is just that, unnecessary. Why would you harm someone who has done nothing wrong to you? Even more so when you steal their stuff, now I'm thinking those 'riots' were just an excuse for looters. Seriously how does stealing a TV makes the government realise that black lives matter? In fact it makes the government think they're a &gt;Tweaked it a little :)

Yeah I think that's better damage wise

&gt;The current meta in AE leans too much towards Pain haha. 

Confuse and Stun statuses aren't given enough attention ;-;

&gt;3 turns seem a bit too harsh for a character that can't deal any damage at all haha.

Yeah at first I thought a stackable 75% Physical and Magical ResistaYeah I was kinda hoping Amy would get hers somehow during the &gt;!part where she reunites with her best friend but forced to fight her for plot!&lt; like how Cyrus, Riica and &gt;!Guildna!&lt; got theirs through main story and chance encounter.

Either they make Aldo's and Amy's signature weapon in the next main story update (or atleast a side stoAh I see well I don't think I have any tanks on my Fire team (which consists of AS Akane, AS Gariyu, Lovely and Aldo) was thinking of changing Aldo with AS Shion but his AF Finisher is pretty handy sometimes. I don't think I would be sidegrading him to his OG anytime soon tho so I guess I'll just stick to him being a tank. Tho should I put MP AND HWell nvm I just made a new setup for macro

Joker: really the only thing is he's the slowest of the team and has an MP Consumption- Badge on to make his Slash use 19MP instead

Mana: Monstro or switch with AS Shanie/Hismena 

Myunfa: Bunbuku Shower so that Joker technically used 0MP

AS Akane: Really only there for switching with Hismena

AS ShanieYou guys make awesome contents for us pleb down here, spent a lot of hours into the game and I gotta say I never knew I would be in love with it

Last year I saw Play Store recommended me Another Eden so I tried it out because it looked awesome, tho a few hours in the game I kinda felt bored and deleted. A few months further I picked it back up andWell Warframe do have Prime Access, plus their drop rate is somewhat bad but not RnG 3 Chants a year bad. 

I just think that raising the drop rates for chants would be beneficial since more people will play more since they know their chances of upgrading their 4.5* has been improved but only if they play through all of their keys.

Sure it's just Hmm then what was diffrent... All I changed was a T1 to a T2, basically Joker should be dealing more damage with or without Amy's VC.

Before the weird SPD buff bug I was using my Joker + Amy macro farm and it did just fine, it killed both Go-wans AND Kyo-wans in one turn. Now he can't kill of the Kyo-wans leaving them with a bit of HP left on themWait regarding the the SPD Buffs bug, is EVERY skill/VC that has SPD buff affected? Like say Amy's VC which boost both PWR and SPD. Does the PWR buff also gets affected? 

Because when I tried to use her VC + Joker's Slash (who has 20/20/20 Fire grasta) he couldn't kill off the Kyo-wans in 1 turn where before (when he only has 10/20/20) he could eaGuess I gotta find a way to implement a PWR buff to make Joker's Slash insta-kills the Go-wans and Kyo-wans...

My idea was to use Myunfa's Bunbuku Shower and Mana's VC for macro farm at Temple Ruins AD so that Joker almost never runs out of MP to use Slash and kill those turdwad statues 

But even with 20/20/20 he still can't seem to kill (either My teams

Fire:
AS Akane, AS Gariyu, Lovely, Aldo and Joker

Earth:
Myunfa, Premaya, Deirdre, Cerrine

Water:
AS/OG+m! Shanie, AS Saki, Hismena, m!Mighty, m!LaClair and Philo

Wind:
AS Ruina, Mona, Amy and m!Azami

As you all know my Earth and Wind teams are still a bit weak (with Wind Team being my weakest currently), with future banners coming upReally you can kill it with just Mona, Amy and Azami but it does require a bit of grasta mainly on Mona

I had 3 T2 grasta on him, 1 T2 on Amy and none on Azami


&gt;Turn 1
Mona: Wind High Booster
Amy: switch from Reserves to Frontlines for PWR and SPD Buff
Azami: Culmination Winds
Since you have him, Dunarith: Breeze Emitter for further Wind damaBeaten the nope snek and gave Kuai Weight to Myunfa I underestimated how strong Premaya's Annihilate already is without Earth Zone


 Annihilate + Earth Zone + Glorious Tea Stalk + 2 T2 Grasta = Snek went down to half its HP


Got surprised when that happened so I went and tackled the boney boi to give Aldo a better sword. Same shit happened so thaI'll be tackling the land snek (Tomoe Snake) tomorrow with Myunfa, Deirdre, Cerrine and Premaya as my Earth team (with Mana and Mona as supports)

Myunfa: MP Consumption- (Hammer) for extra HP and if the fight gets too long

Deirdre: Miaki's Sword as to make her a bit bulkier when doing AF

Cerrine: Dark Spirit Claws and 1 T2 Grasta on

Premaya: Ch
