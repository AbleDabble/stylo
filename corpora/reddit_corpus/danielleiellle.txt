Just to add to the agency caveat: schedules will be demanding, but you also condense a lot of work into your resume through exposure to different projects and clients. It can also mean a lot of travel and perks, so don’t discount it.

The point of flattening the curve was not to wait this out until there was a vaccine.

OP, sign up forI have been to China a couple of times and visited about a dozen research institutions where I interviewed Chinese scientists. It is amazing how they will sit there and tell you China is so innovative, how it takes the world’s ideas and makes them better, and how censorship isn’t really a concern. Then they will turn around and show you how they haThey might also be downvoted because Trump has been attempting to shirk responsibility and point fingers through all of this rather than stepping up as a leader. The initial reporting of this possibly originating in a Chinese lab was first leaked to Fox News, so it was easy to call it another conspiracy theory.
