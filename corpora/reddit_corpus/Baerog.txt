I think the point is that there are two options:

1) You're sick. You have symptoms. You go to get tested. You quarantine in the meantime because you're sick and not sure what you have. You're test comes back **negative**. You're probably no longer symptomatic by the time you get your results, so you're fine to stop quarantining.

2) You're sick. YI mean, not really. When 55.7% of all people voted for *someone*, it's safe to say that the other 45.3% desired votes would be similar to the outcome. It's statistics. If you're trying to make assumptions about a population and you are able to poll more than 50% of the population, you'll get an insanely good representation and the true outcome if yObviously... Conservatives don't support this, but Reddit thinks every conservative is a clone of Trump because redditors seem to form their political beliefs off of whatever the current head of the Democratic party thinks.

Conservatives want people to vote in person, they don't want to move the election, just look at the response on /r/conservatiNot American, but I live in a city that has some covid cases. I wore a mask whenever I went anywhere.

For work I went to a very small, very rural town that has had no covid cases, is pretty isolated, and has a very small population, no one wears a mask and it doesn't really seem like it's necessary frankly. I didn't wear a mask the entire time. ReI have a job where I do both office and field work, depending on the season. I will say that the field work is more demanding and tiring, but office work is a different kind of demanding. I wouldn't discount people's jobs and how difficult or important it is based on whether they get dirty doing it.

Take computer engineers for example. Inarguably I'm not Republican, or even American, but saying "They suppress votes and get foreign help" as the reason that Trump won is extremely naive.

Just because everyone you talk to on reddit and your other mid-twenties friends are Democrats doesn't mean that the Republican party is some extreme minority that only survives with gerrymandering and foreignI agree. It's pushing the pornography creators morality on its users. It's like if you needed to answer questions about the Bible because the creator of the website is Catholic.

People are allowed to think that gays and lesbians will burn in hell, and they're allowed to think trans people are full of shit. They may be an asshole for thinking that,Well, it's different, because he was super hot.

This is the reason why these questions are pointless. Some people don't want anyone to talk to them at all ever and others don't care/like talking to strangers. You can say something and 50% of people will be flattered and 50% will think you're creepy. You literally can't win. There are things that aI don't think anyone should be labeled as a "little bitch" when there's a giant angry mob, many of who would injure you if given the opportunity, right outside where you live. You'd be an idiot to not go into the bunker.

It's like the people making fun of him don't realize that there actually were people there mad enough to potentially kill him...Oh come on, I'm not a Trump supporter, but he's completely right. You know, he knows it, we all know it, and frankly, most people on reddit will agree with you, so I don't know why you bother pretending you mean anything else. 

When people on reddit mention anything they don't like about politics, it's always something that people attribute to theI sort of understand it too, the descent is extremely dangerous, you've used up a lot of your oxygen, you start to get hypoxia and your odds of making a mistake increase. Any mistake up there is a death sentence.

If the options are:

1. Ditch your extra gear you don't need anymore, paying a fine, but increasing your likelihood of survival

2. BrinScience doesn't prove the Bible isnt true. The argument is that science doesn't provide any evidence that suggests there is a god or that miracles performed by Jesus are possible. Saying there is no evidence doesn't mean that its proof something didn't happen.

Science has also found evidence that Jesus was a real person who existed.

Also, I thinkHe never said they had a moral obligation to allow for free speech. He said:

1. Free Speech is a law. 

2. That law was created to support the moral belief that the freedom of speech is good for society.

3. While Facebook has no legal obligation to provide Free Speech on their platform, they support the moral belief of free speech, and hence, allYou seem to be implying that laws should be put in place to essentially say that social media is a public message board. If that was the case, then freedom of speech laws would apply in these places. Freedom of speech laws are very non-restrictive in what they allow for, and likely this would allow for considerablly more "hateful" content (I put haReddit is the definition of echo chambers, they literally have subreddits you can go to to only see opinions you want to see. And most if not all of the political subreddits provide heavily biased articles to the point where they're technically not lying, but spinning it so hard that it's misinformation.

Facebook allows for more free speech than RHonestly, it's not that bad... There's content there I don't agree with, but it's not rabid. It's the best conservative subreddit if you're looking to broaden your views and see what the other side thinks. If you feel gross for seeing opinions you don't agree with, then you need to get out more.

The most offensive post on the front page there righFrom my limited experience going to church as a child, most people donate during the actual mass. No mass, no donations.

I understand that the US wouldn't want all the churches to go under, religion is one of those things that makes some people happy. It's sort of like funding the arts. Does nothing to actually help the economy, but does help sociFree money, yes, but in actuality, it's more like free money for the employees then, because otherwise, they would be laid off most likely.

People talk about how it's free money, but at least 60% of it needs to go to employees. If they didn't give these companies money to pay their employees, the employees would be fired as they would be non-profiWhen people say that people on /r/politics are calm, reasonable, and rational people, look to this comment:

Literally hoping that Trump, Pence, and Bolsonaro die from covid. But no, it's only the right-wing that are hateful, awful people who deserve to be banned.

I hope your 13 year old account gets banned, because honestly, this is the kind of sExcept you can. You can blame the government for imposing rules that make it so that you can't keep your non-profit running because of rules surrounding cash flow. You literally had no chance to survive because the government made it so you couldn't do what you knew you needed to do.

That's 100% what they would say, and the argument seems fair in Black Panther was sold as an all black cast movie in the US. Other countries have little to no black people in them (especially China), so the movie has to stand on its own merit rather than being boosted by the "uniqueness" or desire from minorities to support it.

The original Black Panther poster doesn't even show what the hero looks like and lo&gt;you keep making strawman arguments

No I didn't. You don't know what that means. You can't just throw around words you don't know but have heard before and pretend it means you don't have to make a valid counter-point.

&gt;I didn't say she can make policy

Yes, but the person you're responding for did. He said:

&gt; she can do more than Twitt&gt;I don't think that's actually that curious, or hypocritical, though.

It's not curious, but it is hypocritical.

If you think that people that commit crimes you don't like should be hung and sodomized in prison, but then turn around and say that we need prison reform, you're a hypocrite. Through and through.

You keep ignoring this. **What exactly can she do aside from advising the president, and doing what she is already doing**.

Yes, it's great that you want to repeatedly say that she should do something, but there isn't really anything she can do given her position that &gt; Define Christian

National surveys that ask you if you are Christian or not?

&gt;I think you will find that more people who say they are Christian are somewhere on the spectrum of racist than you would imagine.

"I think you'll find that more people who say they are atheists are somewhere on the spectrum of pedophile than you would imagine."
&gt;While I don't hate her, she doesn't deserve all of these mental gymnastics you're doing for her, either.

It's mental gymnastics to say that someone might be posting something that they **actually** believe in and that it's not some 5D chess play for political favor, like the OP and comments say?

It's mental gymnastics to say that people are aWhat actions should she be taking? She is an advisor, she has no power to create policy. The only action she can take is telling people what they should do in a "non-official" capacity and doing those things herself, which she has and is doing.

Don't shit on someone just because you have a preconceived desire to hate them. Her **actions** are goodIt's implied by his statement:

&gt;she can do more than Twitter a message.

No, she can not actually. She can try to advise Donald on what to do, which presumably she has, given her clearly public opinion on mask wearing. She is **not** in a position of creating policy. That is not what advisors do.

You realize Dr. Fauci is an advisor to the presDoesn't matter to Reddit. Funny that people who pretend to be so smart, so educated, so open-minded are actually just moronic bigots who get into a frenzy when they see someone is a Republican and bash their views.

But no, apparently, by law, children are required to share 100% of the political views of their parents (I'm sure all Redditors do as &gt;she can do more than Twitter a message.

Really? She can? She has the power to overstep Trumps decision? I didn't realize that the Senior Advisor actually had the power to make decisions for the President.

Do you really think that she isn't fully aware that she does not have the power to change Trumps mind? She would know better than anyone inNo. Not true. If you support a political party, you align 100% with that parties views, in fact, you actually slowly become the person who leads that party. You start by adopting their habits and mannerisms, then you begin to speak like them and dress like them. You hire a private investigator so you can begin to eat like them. Eventually you get a&gt;she should direct these statements towards her family. She has power and influence, use it.

Except she clearly doesn't... How many times have you argued with your parents to try to change their mind on something? It's not possible. There's no point, she'd just be ruining her relationship with her family for no gain. 

She clearly disagrees wit&gt; it's a complete hoax and the supposed "hot spots" used crisis actors to fill up their hospitals.

If the threat level was very low, but the government wanted you to think it was high, they would obviously have to fNone of those things are "BLM protestors are terrorists"...?

Those are just right-wing people having right-wing opinions and making the same exaggerated statements that /r/politics makes. So what exactly is your point here? 

It's more acceptable for /r/conservative to be conservative, because it's literally in their name, but /r/politics being /rI don't go on /r/conservative, or any other political subreddit because internet politics is cancer, but I guarantee that you're misrepresenting /r/Conservative's opinion. They likely said "BLM protesters destroying businesses and starting fires are terrorists". Which is a significantly less controversial opinion. 

Looking at it right now, I don'tNothing had been posted on /r/the_Donald in almost 5 months, they all left once the reddit Admins performed a hostile takeover and made it so they couldn't replace their mods with anyone who had posted on any other conservative subreddit, meaning that the mods could only be replaced by people who didn't support /r/the_Donald... Which obviously makeRacism is racism. Sexism is sexism. Prejudice comes from everywhere and targets everyone, and it's always bad. Don't defend being prejudice against white people because you think that white people don't "need the protection". No one needs protection from someone saying mean words online, but if you're going to apply rules that protect people from hAlmost like Reddit is basing its policies off of extremely liberal arts major discussion points, the kind of people who say that white people (men specifically) cause all the problems in the world and would be better off not existing.

I wonder if Spez agrees with all of this himself, or if he's just trying to not get canceled by the vocal minorityDid you just unironically equate /r/conservative to /r/the_Donald in terms of civility? And in the same paragraph claim that /r/politics is civil? 

This is why people who identify as left-leaning are seen as incredibly biased from anyone right of left on Reddit...

You equate anything that isn't left-wing to be uncivil, no matter what content theyGenuine question: How can someone expect to be accepted as a legal citizen when they immediately broke a pretty major law by illegally entering the country? (Or perhaps not immediately as most illegal immigrants overstay visas)

If you want to be accepted as a citizen, you should go through the appropriate channels, like all the other legal immigraThey don't value free speech. It's abundently clear. Reddit is a horrible site. They downvote things they don't agree with, even though it's explicitly stated in the reddiquette that is not why the downvote button exists.

3. Facebook supports free speech anyways because they **want to**.

It's a term that the meaning has completely shifted, at least in that sector. No one thinks of racism and actual slavery when referring to a "Master Copy" of a spreadsheet, or a Master device in tech. 

Words have meaning outside their connotation. You might think it's dumb to say, but really, it would be confusing to changHow does Facebooks policy of allowing free speech on their platform equate to apathy? Or evil?

We all support free speech when it comes to the constitution, no? So Facebook is extending that idea to their platform. And yet, they're the bad guys?

Oh, we don't support free speech? We only support it when it's thing we like to hear? Oh. I see. Okay."Master" and "Slave" in tech is the actual perfect descriptor. A slave device is subject to the will of the master device. Slavery isn't necessarily racist, it's not like African tribes didn't take other Africans as slaves.

Or, for an even bigger disconnect from White people, South American natives taking other tribes as slaves after battles.

SlaYou realize they need to look through the footage to make sure there's nothing that can't be public in it, right?

On a per capita basis, maybe? There's no such thing as "zero deaths", that sounds like some bullshit campaign a local government runs under.

In reality, you need to look at per-capita death rates, and yes, if you have a deadly virus, some people will die, and yes, if you have 10x the population, don't be surprised when 10x the people dieThank god, you're the only logical person here. Trumps job was never to control the state Healthcare systems. Notice how some states are doing fine and others are fucked? (And it's not a Democrat/Republican divide).

Put the blame where it belongs, on the state government and state Healthcare systems. Some of them responded appropriately, others diTo play devils advocate: Is murdering fetuses of perfectly fine babies who will grow up to be members of society a good thing? Or a bad thing?

I have first hand and now second hand experience working with the university and it is shameful how horribly run it is and how many employees are there collecting a massive paycheck and doing absolutely nothing.

Anyone who uses this as a point against the Facebook is arguably easier to ignore things you don't like, just remove those people as friends. You can't avoid anonymous users going into a subreddit and saying things you don't want to hear.

Reddit has exactly the same problems, the people here just like it... I prefer reddit and don't use Facebook, but that's because reddit is a link aggregatI mean, the protest organizers who want to retain their ability to commandeer part of a city are of course going to say that their response to a shooting was better than the police would have... If they admitted they prevented emergency services from getting to the site and prevented the ability to find the shooter then they would be rightfully takIf you read the article, they're ranking based on English-speaking forums. So think of all the people who post on English-speaking forums, organize them by population based on the country they're from.

It will be US&gt; UK &gt; Canada &gt; Australia &gt; Something else. Guess what order they rank these "White supremacist" countries in? The same orDo you even live in Alberta? You can't just spew the same shit that Reddit spews about how Alberta is some toxic racist cesspool without any actual experience. It's really not... 99.9% of people in Alberta are just normal Canadians like everyone else... Or normal people, like 99.9% of the world. Racism exists, but by and large, the massively overwiI feel like this is pretty normal no matter where you live. I've felt excluded from coworker groups that were primarily Filipino for example, but I get it, there is a culture gap there that I recognized at the time. People tend to be friends with people similar to them. An Indian-Canadian who is "culturally Canadian" is different from an Indian-CanI'm from Alberta and I've never experienced racism as bad as rural Manitoba. You shouldn't generalize against rural Albertans. Also, most people are completely normal and not racist, even in Alberta, despite what Reddit might suggest. Supporting the oil and gas industry and voting for political parties that do as well makes you evil on Reddit.
