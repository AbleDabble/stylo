Agreed. He basically got Bol Bol with a live dribble version of the (triple threat) sweep in the video.

But let's not fool ourselves, CP3 also has incredible quickness in not just his lower body but also his core/upper body--even when I slow down the video I can barely make out when he gathers the ball in the shot pocket to when he raises the ballThat's interesting. A plyometric program I'm currently working with includes (I think) exactly the kind of deep breathing exercise as the final part of cool down and to be honest I've just been skipping it (but not without some level of guilt). Does it really offer tangible benefits? How long would the parasympathetic activation take naturally, witThanks. My warm-up routine for both basketball and other workouts is basically a combination of mobility exercises and dynamic stretching, something like [this](url) \+ [this](url).

It takes me something like 10-15 minutes and honestly I have to force myself to keep doing it. I have to keep telling myself 1) it doesn't just warm up, but also improI've been really enjoying your YouTube contents Dr. Brar! Here's a quick question I've been meaning to ask for a long time:

Beyond general fitness/health, what suggestions do you have for a 40-something hoping to keep playing basketball for as long as possible? I've been fortunate enough to have avoided major injuries and to still enjoy playing atDon’t have primary sources handy, this is just off the top of my head from textbook blurbs I’ve used in the past:

1) Stability of (measurable) personality traits increases with age—can fluctuate quite a bit when young, but becomes more and more set in stone as one gets older.

2) There are some “personality” traits that are especially evident evenBy the same logic (COVID deaths not as bad as smoking deaths) we definitely overreacted after 9/11—starting a war after a mere 3k deaths!? Suckers.

Your other points are valid though. 100% shut down was never going to be feasible, and even public health experts agree that some compromises had to be made. But you are doing your argument a disservicI think a lot of the comments here complaining about trolls asking for source in bad faith is missing the point—providing a source is not only to bolster your own argument (against trolls, this is impossible), but to educate others.

And people are allowed level constructive critique against your source as well, it is possible that your source isn’Except that is not what I’m insinuating at all and you’re putting words in my mouth. If you refer back to my previous distinction of stereotype=ideas, prejudice=feelings, racism=practices, I actually think it makes sense to describe systems, institutions, laws and regulations as racist, but never describe people as racist—like your example. DebatinI was actually hoping that by scrapping the vaguely defined common usage we can avoid unproductive debates about semantics altogether.

For example, “Blacks are just as prejudiced, and harbor stereotypical beliefs about other races, as whites do, but whites do not face the same hurdles of racist policies and practices as blacks,” feels like a prettI honestly don’t know where you get that from? Mine was just a linguistic point: using “racist” as a blanket term to describe a huge set of topics is just as unproductive as being limited to using only plus signs for multiplication problems. 

Feel free to take this discussion to wherever your politics compels you, but it’s stopped being a producti&gt; Racism is racism.

I cannot disagree more. Calling someone a racial slur is not the same thing as kneeling on their neck, for example. Having “racist” thoughts is not the same as living in a “racist” society. Not saying one is better or worse than the other, clearly these are related phenomenons, but they require different approaches.

The worI really wish people can stop using the adjective “racist” to refer to “prejudiced.” Of course blacks can be just as prejudiced or worse as whites, and it’s fair to say that whites today as a whole are experiencing increasing levels of prejudice amidst the cultural backlash (whether or not that’s a problem is debatable because—), but whites are notDevil’s advocate: that’s not really critical thinking though, that’s just a judgment based on an appeal to (medical/scientific) authority, basically the same reasoning process of people trusting Carl’s and Trump’s (political/ingroup) authority.

Listening to their advice and parsing through the (medical vs political) reasons for said advice and makA lot of conditioning tips here already so maybe a skills tip: Work on moves out of the triple threat that don’t require a lot of movement (e.g. think Melo’s jab jab pullup) and use those to rest when you get gassed during the game. There’s a video of Fred VanVleet on youtube playing 1s, basically 100% out of the triple threat and never using more Head over to /r/bodyweightfitness, it's a great community and their [recommended routine](url) is a great resource for exercises using body weight only.

For push-ups, you can follow [this general progression](url) of exercises that increases in difficulty, start with pushing against the wall, to push up on an incline, to full pushups and beyond. BIt's not like needing a screen is a sin or something. Screens are useful for a reason &amp; lots of players make careers out of working from the pick and roll.

If you are strictly talking about improving in iso situations &amp; being able to create enough space to drive/shoot without a screen, well the answer is pretty obvious: you need to improveRather than practicing random collection of moves, build them as series of moves and counters and counter to counters. 

For example: from triple threat, option A is just jump shot, option B is pump fake (&amp; opponents bites on jumpshot) and drive right, option C is jab right (&amp; opponents bites on drive right) and cross step drive left, optioWould you agree with my paraphrase of your view: problem with democracy is that political arguments dissolves into impassioned value judgments of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, which prevents more level-headed discussion of which policies should be prioritized and the best ways to achieve them? I agree with this, and I think many of the comments hFull disclosure: I started watching the NBA in the 90s, so I had no first-hand exposure to the Bad Boys or the Showtimes, but I'm by no means someone who only started following the league this millennium via social media. But even I had to hold back my  initial knee jerk reaction of treating your post as some "back in my olden days" rant of old-timMy story was a little different. I grew up in a 3 generation family with grandparents. My grandma has always criticized my mom’s cooking. Some of it was probably the typical Asian mother vs daughter in-law drama, some of it was different tastes in regional Chinese cooking (grandma was Cantonese, mom came from Shanghai family), some of it was probabThat’s not a very good analogy. Food products have high elasticity of demand—if one food item becomes too expensive, consumers have a lot of freedom to switch to a different brand or choose a different product. 

Healthcare products don’t work the same way as is currently set up, e.g. if one gets sick, there aren’t multiple alternative treatments tIf you can already shoot, pump and drive, and (when available) post up, that’s already a really solid offensive skill set; if you can do all 3 efficiently, on the move, from all over the court, that’s like a coach’s wet dream in a dribble drive offense.

Pretty sure Bolton at this point is after a longer paragraph in the history books. If he aided the impeachment, he is merely a supporting actor, on the (likely) losing side, and a footnote. With a book, now his name will be boldfaced in its own section aNo I get your distinction here. I think it’s a really interesting discussion about who’s great vs who’s revolutionary. I just don’t think you’re right about Nash’s revolutionary impact on bridging the gap between post-up and iso-heavy 90s to the pace and space 2010s. Obviously he didn’t make it happen on his own, but he has definitely been pegged aCan you elaborate on Elgin's revolutionary-ness? As a Clippers' fan, I have only known him as Sterling's yes-man. People before my time gush praise about Baylor, I know he has a statue and all, but I guess I don't have the proper context of how basketball was played during the times when Baylor played. Clips of Maravich's play still wows today (&amAdmitting that Nash was great but not revolutionary seems like a distinction without a difference to me. Sure there are other teams that played fast before the Suns, but it was always viewed as a gimmick until the Suns. The &lt;7sec Suns were revolutionary to the league at the time, and most viewed Nash as the main engine. Being the main driver of 3 hours? That’s a lot of time already. If you need extra conditioning other than just playing/practicing, you’re probably not working very hard. I’m guessing you’re walking after your rebounds and standing around between shots? Taking your shots easy and not at game speed? 

Why run extra when you can just play yourself into shape? Google and watchPretty sure if one cares to dig around more, there could easily be another half dozen showing that childhood SES matters a lot more than your cherry-picked half dozen.

For example, you could have the genetic potential of anywhere from 12 to 36 inch vertical, but how much you maximize or With the changes to G league and the pathway programs already impacting college recruiting, I think smart organizations are probably exploring ways to develop/attract talent to their G league franchises as a feeder to their team.

Basketball shoes are useful to keep your feet in optiTo me this question is kind of missing the point. It can be any quantity, when you get to the point where you can’t have fun UNLESS you have X amount of alcohol.

When the asterisk gets so big, the only Other posters have already talked about the higher expected values of 3s. Another aspect is that your threat of taking 3s also draws in the defense and increase the spacing for your teammates and make it easier for the to score. Taking mid range 2s may be a great shot for you if you’re efficient with it, but the threat doesn’t help your teammates aThen why are you playing basketball? It’s a game, you are supposed to have fun doing it, why PLAY if it’s getting you down? 

I would find ways to enjoy playing and practicing, and have fun noticing the incremental improvements (“I’m 0.1% better than yesterday!”) than your overall performance. Everyone is going to hit their ceiling as a player but But logical truths are only true given the premises, so in a way mathematical truths are no more or less meaningful then a statement like “‘A’ is the first letter of the English alphabet.” I am not sure you can simply draw a straightforward equivalence between physical reality and our mathematical/logical model of it either. Most people think of maGotya. I sort of think of them as similar moves, at least footwork wise. 62 (in KD’s video) begins with a left handed dribble and a left foot side-step to begin the “float,” but it would be pretty close if he had began with a right-to-left crossover and a left foot side-step to begin the “float” no?

If you have more specific goals though, like increasing mobility/flLA Clippers. I'm too lazy to think of a full starting 5 so just guard, wings, and bigs:

Guard: Shaun Livingston. Hard to say his injury was the result of mis-utilization, but definitely one of the most intriguing "what-if" players. As a distant second, I would have loved to watch a non-smoking Teodosic in his prime as a Clipper.

Wings: Joe InglesI actually disagree with many of these. Aside from the recency bias, Lonzo, Russel, Ingram, Clarkson are now basically improved versions of pretty much the same players they were back then. Lonzo, Russel, Ingram were utilized exactly the same as their roles today.
