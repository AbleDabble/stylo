Yes... you would be.  In that moment you shoot you have to be ending a threat of that moment.  Not a past threat.

Why are you directly ignoring information provided you in the links and the name you could Google yourself?  Calling murders warfare is really shitty.  

The cops shouldn't be outfitted for war, and his concerns should have been taken seriously.  The LAPD in particular is a special level of evil.   

But Dorner also murdered people that had nothing to do with it.   It wasn't a war.  It was a murder spree.  The cops made it even worse and hurt innocent peoOk?  I didn't say they didn't.  The cops were evil and crazy, too.  In fact, I pointed it out in other comments to bring attention to that before commenting to this guy.  

Trying to downplay Dorner's murders by the the people that the cops shot after later is What-About-ism.  Rise above that.  

We can point out that Dorner killed innocent people I don't know why you're being downvoted so hard.  The guy's name is Thomas Buhls and he's a very prominent white supremacy advocate.  He writes papers and articles about white supremacy.  He left the KKK because they were too passive for his tastes.   

He has directly said he wants an all white government and civilization.  

The guy is nuts.  LooYeah, I've specifically talked about those.  Doesn't do a thing against Dorner shooting innocent people.  

&gt; He was at war and there were casualties.

Holy fucking shit.  You beleive someone can go up and shoot your family because you have some cousin that's trash and you're ok woth someone going "he was at war and there were casualties"?

You'Well there is [this](url).

[And this](url).  

He is in White Nationalist groups though not specifically named the KKK anymore.  He was a member.  

The reason he isn't in the KKK now?  [He claims the KKK is too passive for his tastes](url).

Too passive.

His name is Thomas Buhls and he wants this attention.  He wants people to know he's a self dHe killed the daughter of a cop and her fiance just because they were related to the cop.  They were in a car alone not at the cop's house.  

He did target innocent people.  Don't sweep that away.  Doing that is no better than defending police unconditionally.  

Now the corruption he tried to expose was real.  And he tried initially to go the rigAnd the innocent people the cops shot.  

It was really weird.  

Now Dorner was also nuts.  He killed *family members* of cops to get back at the cops.  That's evil.  But what he had tried to expose was real, and the way cops reacted (setting him on fire, shooting any vehicle even if it didn't look like his, etc) was crazy evil.  

Dorner should h&gt; why was it a no knock warrant 

They broke protocol on that- judge needs to be investigated too

&gt; why was it in the middle of the night

Partially because they're idiots and partially because they intentionally wanted the ex in custody first so he wouldn't be tipped off to run due to the raid.  They also wouldn't want time to pass for her &gt; There is no way they should have been able to get a no knock warrant looking for contraband and not a dangerous person

Its already confirmed that even if they had told the truth the judge shouldn't have granted it anyways.  They had rules around the no-knock being because the target had a security system or cameras that they "needed" to act fLiterally didn't matter.  The raid on her place was for the packages not him.   

Now they're shit eating pigs that are lower than dirt, don't get me wrong.  These cops are awful.  They lied on reports, their warrant, put the lives of over a dozen people at risk, etc.  

But the fact that the ex was already in custody has nothing to do with the rai&gt; when this broke

Yeah, when we didn't have the full story.  Its been months now and its been pretty well detailed what happened for quite a while.  

The raid wasn't for the guy.  You can stop copy-pasting the caps.  The raid was for packages.  It literally doesn't matter that the guy was already caught.  

Can we please stop muddling facts anEveryone keeps repeating this.  They knew the ex wasn't there.  They were raiding her place because they thought she was getting packages for him.  She wasn't.  The lie was that they said that USPS had confirmed that she was getting his packages when it was the opposite - they confirmed that she ***wasn't*** getting his packages.   They lied and clNo.  I don't know why people keep repeating this.  

They were after her because of her ex.  They were watching her to see if she was getting packages for him (USPS confirmed she wasn't).  It was the correct address for the raid they wanted.  She was just innocent.  

The bad parts are (1) the lied and said the USPS confirmed she was getting his paBecause they claimed their evidence she was a suspect was that USPS data showed her receiving packages for her ex, which USPS has since denied.  Someone made up the USPS info and applied for a warrant using it.

It isn't legal.  Good lord.  It is not legal to point a gun at someone if you aren't defending yourself from immediate threat.  

Please tell me you don't have a carry license.  They shouldn't have given you one if you didn't k&gt; This absolutely could count as an immediate threat, and it is arguing in bad faith to suggest either wise.

No it can't.  My carry class literally covered a case like this when discussing when you can fire.  Someone legally carrying and walking to you doesn't count.  Them being by your car doesn't count.  

My point was that a couple that liteNo, approaching does not count as immediate danger.  The driver could reasonably draw, but not fire.   

Anyone who took a carry class *and actually paid attention* should know that you can't shoot someone without immediate threat to your life.  Suspecting something may happen you can draw, but you don't fire until there is an immediate threat.  

&gt; Why are you neglecting the part of the story where Garret walked up and pointed his AK at the man in the car, and THEN proceeded to get his ass lit up?

Because none of the evidence or video supports that. At all.  Infact his arm position would point it at the ground.  

Only one person out of all witnesses says he pointed it at the car - and What?  Yes there is video.  He didn't fire a single shot.  

He was shot by the driver.  

It is really clear what happened.  Police, protestors, and the driver have all agreed that Foster walks up to the car (which had driven into a crowd) and the driver shoots him for it.  Foster didn't shoot.  A different protestor shot at the driver as a responPretty much all so far.  Go over to /r/progun about any protestor that was legally carrying and they discuss how that's *not what having a gun should be like* yet have multiple threads about how the couple in St Louis that swept a crowd with her finger on the trigger shouldn't be in trouble.  

For the specific incident where a guy was called a LAREh... most Republicans don't care what happens to "criminals" in prison and make dropping the soap jokes.  Remember that protecting only ***their*** rights are important.  Not everyone else.

They say "he came to LARP and&gt; Odd, witnesses including his mother are still claiming he didn't have a gun and was pushing a wheelchair.

No one has said that.  He was a proud gun owner.  But yes he was helping his fiance in a wheelchair.  You can do both.  

He brought a gun because he's legally allowed to arm himself.  You're against the 2nd amendment?  You don't beleive So here's the question for you.  Do you not believe the driver?  Because the driver said he himself shot first.  Do you not believe the investigation so far?   Because the initial report is that the driver shot first.  Do you not believe any witnesses, because they say the driver shot first.
