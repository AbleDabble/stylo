How could they have not gotten this message? The sobbing of the crocodile tears are so loud the whole world got the message that blegans literally want to destroy the indigenous way of life and that the noble twitter users who continue to support industries that deforest the land they depend on, mass exterminate the animals they need to live, and poison the water from which they drink are the ones who are REALLY looking out for their interests. And definitely not because they want to keep stuffing their deformed faces with processed meat and cow juice while browsing the internet looking for fringe causes to grandstand on without making any real impact that would require even the slightest inconvenience for themselves.Loba one is just kinda the same suggestion post regarding buffing the bracelet over and over, but the mirage one is really funny and I've actually learned a good amount from it. I just started and I'm not too in love with the idea of buying legends, so I'm trying to decide who to get for my next legend (when I get enough levels) and the mirage sub is leaning on me pretty hard to get him.I also think another benefit to bringing in Wilson is he'll be a great teacher for our extremely young LB corps.

Wilson has more than double the number of games played than our next closest LB, and although Singleton is older than him, Wilson has played his entire career in the big leagues, fighting for his spot as a UDFA. I imagine he'll be a great guiding force for Bradley and Taylor, both of whom (the former especially) I'm very excited for.

Losing experienced guys like Grugier-Hill, Riley, Bradham, and Jenkins (who basically flexed to linebacker on some snaps) definitely brought some concerns, but hopefully our linebackers can see some nice development this year.They are arguably the worst team since the pre-Crosby penguins (only difference being there isn't a consensus #1 overall pick projected to be a generational talent in the draft) with one of the worst prospect pools in the league in a year where scouting draftees is a complete guess so even if they get the #1 pick (it's lottery so they could miss), there's no guarantees they get the right player. 

The only way they could possibly be in a worse position is if the NHL was a non-salary cap league like the MLB.I highkey love the idea of these two kids being super grizzled and jaded mets superfans who act like 40-somethings who are old enough to remember decades of long island sports related trauma, but too young to remember a world series win.

Is that a concept for a comedy show already? Because if not, I'm willing to entertain some offers here. I think this thing has legs.It's like how people shit-talked the warriors, eagles, and all the other teams that refused the visit to the White House. "If you really cared and wanted to get something done, you would have gone and had a discussion with Trump!" As if Trump would have done anything but take a photo, shake hands, make some bizarre speech about how he is persecuted, or [do whatever the hell this is](https://i.imgur.com/u7mB7hU.png), before laughing at them and dropping out to make his tee time.You'll probably like Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus and Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! if you're into that 2000s indie sound.

I always struggle to recommend the "Synth Trilogy" (Push the Sky Away, Skeleton Tree, and Ghosteen), since the content of those albums is so heavy, while also being pretty distinct from a lot of his other work in terms of the instruments and sounds, but they are truly some of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.

The 2nd and 3rd albums (Skeleton Tree and Ghosteen) revolve around the tragic death of one of his teenage sons and are a very intense meditation on living with grief. So I highly recommend them as I consider the whole trilogy to be one of the finest achievements in music (and I would say try to listen to them concurrently if possible, but they are around 2.5 hours total so that's not always feasible), but with the warning that they get as dark as you can possible imagine, and perhaps even darker.For the past few years I've been sending letters to a player, simply requesting a nice game of catch. But he hasn't responded A SINGLE TIME. I don't understand, I think he and I are so alike, and I've told him multiple times how much I love his hair and how fast he runs. I don't think he's gotten any of my letters, which is a shame, because I'm sure our relationship would be a real home run!Just ignoring that the designer, Frehley loves nazi memorabilia and that almost certainly influenced his design? Here's another photo of two members of Kiss wearing some... [interesting outfits](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ksay9fWFUB1qao0pno1_400.jpg). And by the way, the guy on the right is Stanley (who is Jewish), who levied the accusations against Frehley and Criss. He clearly was okay with nazi imagery at the time when the band was a monstrous success, same way plenty of players in pro sports silently tolerate their teammates bigotry while playing beside them. 

And saying that Simmons and Stanley continuing to deny the logo's potential nazi origins isn't as big of a shutdown as you think it is. This band is the biggest sellout in the history of bands selling out. They sell kiss-labeled merchandise EVERYTHING. You can even get a kiss coffin. You'd be crazy to want to destroy your brand by confirming that the logo, which is bringing in million and millions of dollars by itself, is a nazi image. 

There were a lot of rock bands in the 70s that borrowed nazi imagery for their designs, another notable example being Motorhead, whose designer, Lemmy, [is also fond of nazi memorabilia.](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c7/a0/d3/c7a0d3294dd2986aeed0612b9350499b.jpg)

>From the beginning of time, the bad guys always had the best uniforms. Napoleon, the Confederates, the Nazis. They all had killer uniforms. I mean, the SS uniform is fucking brilliant! They were the rock stars of that time. What you're gonna do? They just look good

[From an interview with Lemmy](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/11/news.culture). 

So many rock bands were trying to be edgy rebels in the 70s, its not a stretch of the imagination that Kiss, like many others, drew from nazi imagery for their logo.So last year, the NFC East division was BAD, like REALLY BAD. By the final week of the regular season, the eagles were already out and had nothing to play for. However, their final game of the season was against WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, and because the giants had won their game against the cowboys earlier that day, the eagles effectively decided who would go into the playoffs. If they beat the WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, then the giants would go, if they lost then WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM would advance. 

About 3/4 of the way through the game, the eagles are only 3 points behind, when they seemingly randomly decide to pull their starting QB, Jalen Hurts, for a less than stellar 3rd stringer, Nate Sudfeld. While Doug Pederson (the recently fired coach of the eagles) had said they were going to give Sudfeld some playing time, there were many who cried foul that the eagles were intentionally trying to lose, which they did. Sudfeld looked absolutely awful and it was clearly not a decision made with any intention to win. Plenty of teams do this in the final few weeks of the season and most of the time it goes without any noise. But, because this decision kept the giants out of the playoffs, NY sports media had a meltdown of incredible proportions. 

While they were mostly just rants made by lunatic fans who probably forgot about it in a week or so, there were some very funny incidents. Like people saying that Pederson got paid off by WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM to throw the game, or that the eagles should be investigated and stripped of picks for 'disrespecting the league' by tanking. [And all of this was further stoked by giants players and their coaching staff complaining on twitter and in pressers](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-players-are-furious-on-twitter-after-eagles-bench-jalen-hurts-vs-washington/). Plus, there's the whole NYC - Philly rivalry which goes back generations before you and I were born.

I was just poking fun and trying to do some lighthearted jabbing btw, not trying to start any serious flame war.Huh, that surprises me. I would have figured our worst would be Kotite, but I suppose he was carried by Cunningham's amazing ability and one of the best d-lines of the 90s to an at least mediocre record. Even though he was fired years before I was born, I still think about that "Hey, 8-8 is great" quote when he had one of the most talented QBs of all time in his prime and I start to get angry.There's this one picture of Dick Allen, a recently passed MLB player who will likely be in the Hall of Fame next go around, that was being taken at the stadium for his rookie baseball card. While the picture was being taken, some fans were screaming the n-word at him, and you can just see the weariness in his eyes, knowing he has put up with this his whole life and will have to do so for the rest of his career. The abuse was so bad, he wore his batting helmet while fielding, which is extremely uncommon, just to protect himself from the things people threw at him. 

I think about that picture a lot, and wish it and all the others like it were just a relic of the 1960s when sports, at least here in America, were still in the infancy stages of integration. It's easy to think that things are better, and maybe in a lot of ways they are, but there's still so much ground to cover, I don't know if we'll get through this in my lifetime.[Last summer in Philadelphia, there was the largest BLM rally in the entire country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwtZKsBJmyA), with massive protests all across the city. On the other side of the state of Pennsylvania, in Allegheny County (About 500 KM) away, there were almost no protests to speak of. 

And yet, Philadelphia, which is a far larger and more densely populated region than Allegheny County, had significantly less covid cases per capita during that time. Some speculate this is because Philadelphia has the [highest percentage of mask-wearing individuals of any major city in the entire country](https://billypenn.com/2020/07/19/philly-mask-compliance-high-coronavirus-cdc-director-mandatatory/), whereas Allegheny County... they do not.

-San Patricio by The ChieftainsI think we should give KD the benefit of the doubt since he did end up unliking the post. It's very possible he just liked it without actually reading or watching the clip. Hell, before this whole thing blew up and when I followed Jackson on instagram (emphasis on when), I almost liked that video of Farrakhan just out of habit. And I've hated Farrakhan for years, I just didn't recognize him and saw it on my feed. I follow less than 100 people, KD follows thousands, it's genuinely possible he just didn't notice it and was liking something one of his friends posted. And this is coming from a certified KD hater and a diehard fan of a rival team.This season peaked for me as a Celtic fan with that video of someone crashing a plane into Ibrox on Flight Sim. 

That video was released before a single game was played.

 I am a hollow man these days and the only way I can get a sense of meager joy is by scoffing at Rangers fans celebrating. Don't take the only remaining good thing left in my life, please.I 100% agree that it was gross how they gave him a 'rockstar' treatment, but I feel his fate somewhat redeems it. Trapped in a summer camp to be tortured and killed by his victims for all of eternity seems like a pretty fitting end for such a horrible human being. 

I do wish they gave us more catharsis and focused on how he was essentially in Hell being punished for his sins, but it did go a long way to washing the bitter taste from my mouth.I meant more like he'll be invited for a permanent role rather than just a stand-in for an injured / protocoled player. I doubt he'll be invited for the starting roster next year but I am very confident he'll be in the starting 22 within 3 years.  I definitely think he'll be in the next batch of callups if (hopefully not when) the next outbreak occurs.I'll admit I'm not familiar with the LA sports scene from anything but my east coast perspective, so I just assumed that people are fans of either the premier team or the secondary teams with no intermingling.

At least, that's how I would be were I an LA sports fan. If I were an angels fan I wouldn't want to support the team that is mostly dodgers fans.

I love hearing about fandom divides, what teams are considered "common ground" for bitter, blood rivals is really interesting. It's unfortunately a small market so it's not talked about that much, but it's interesting how Cincinnati and Cleveland kind of treat the Blue Jackets as a demilitarized zone between their bitterly rivaled cities.The craziest thing about Gretzky is he retired relatively early too! He was embarrassed that people were clearly avoiding hitting him as no one wanted to be the guy who ended the career of The Great One. He felt that if he kept playing he would be hurting the integrity of the sport, so he gave it up when he still had more in the tank. He reasonably could have kept playing for several more years, and while he was past his peak, he was still easily a top tier player at the time of his retirement.

His records could have truly been untouchable if he kept playing until he physically couldn't anymore.Duce is a great one. His ability to develop running backs is crazy strong. 

I remember the first few weeks of the 2019 season, many fans were complaining about Miles Sanders being a bust. After Duce worked with him, Sanders became a top 5 RB in the league. 

He turned Corey Clement into a massive contributor to a Super Bowl winner. He turned Boston Scott into a known name. He turned a rotation of Josh Adams / Wendell Smallwood into a playoff winner. One of the most underrated assistant coaches in the NFC.

I'm so happy he ended up with you guys, the lions are my second team in the NFC and I'm thrilled to see how he does with you. 

You're going to love him.I just like all of Detroit's teams. Red Wings, Tigers, Pistons, and Lions. They're my second team in every sport.

I like their history, which is often tragic and full of grit. They're a classic underdog who you always want to root for. Also, I see a lot of similarities between them and Philadelphia with the cities being unfairly maligned and picked on with lazy, cheap shots. 

When a fanbase / city is being mocked, they are essentially split up into two groups. The first being those that give in and whine, hoping to be so pathetic and pitiable people leave them alone (Minneapolis). The second being those that close ranks and rally together to protect the pride of their city.

Detroit falls firmly into the latter category, in my opinion. They make a good story of people who, even with all the odds against them, still believe in those three magical words: "maybe next year."Did he actually have a testicular contusion that put him in the hospital and required immediate treatment? That's not just getting hit in the balls, that's getting hit so hard that the entire sack starts swelling and doctors have to intervene to save it.

Plenty of MLB players get hit in the balls at some point, and many stay in. [Here's Didi Gregorius getting a bouncing ball to the donger](https://imgur.com/IRZ7j3x) and then he proceeds to [avenge his peen the very next inning](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/934a5658-ac9f-49d0-aa9b-8145e70f42c7.mp4)This is what I find truly frightening about Gritty.

We have no idea who the guy is. We all know who the phanatic is played by, as well as most other mascots, we have zero idea who plays Gritty. But, whoever they rare, they're incredibly athletic. 

[They can run very quickly in that suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M96PnqXYaf4)

[They're an incredibly good skater](https://youtu.be/-axO798ht4Y?t=93)

And just being generally rather nimble with climbing over seats, throwing things at people, and they've got one hell of a right hook, as that uppity 12 year old is now aware.

And, it turns out, they've got a strong golf drive.

Also, I vaguely recall someone posting some  analysis of the costume saying that the person inside of it has to be at least 6'5" and very strong to be able to move that suit so gracefully. 
 
The mystery of Gritty is by far the most disturbing part of him. What kind of person possesses all those skills and what other abilities do they have hidden within them. The only way to avoid genuinely fearing Gritty is to worship him.I think there are circumstances where it's appropriate to be angry at a player for getting a massive contract and then just not trying at all. That has never applied to Tobi or even Horford, for that matter. For however bad those two were, even the latter, they always seemed to be putting in the effort and trying their best. Especially with the amount of hate Tobi got, it's very admirable that he shut it all out and focused on improving his game to the highest degree.

Hell, I remember there were some fans who were making jokes after that scary head injury he had back in the bubble. It takes a person of high character to go out and play your hardest knowing you're playing for those scumfuck's entertainment.

That's the kind of athlete that will THRIVE in Philly.Unrelated, but I absolutely adore those away whites for Montreal. They're so nice, the blue stripe combined with the blue pants and the red shoulders are just perfection. I don't know if this makes sense, but that jersey just "feels" like Montreal. Artistic, minimalist, and extremely tasteful. They're honestly my favorite current jersey in the league, although the flyers winter classic from 2012 still holds the title for favorite.

If they ever change it, I'm knocking Montreal up to a top 5 hated team.Thank you so much, sir. I hope you know how much everyone loves you and the awesome community you've essentially created from nothing. 

I'm an out of market fan and I've actually never met another flyers fan (outside of family and visits to Philly, that is), so the chat is to me the equivalent of watching games with buds who also care about the team and develop their own mannerisms and jokes related to the flyers.

I owe you that. I don't think I would have been able to sustain my passion without that awesome chat. I love that some bongos can get my heart racing, and the mere mention of a certain NASCAR driver can send me into unexplainable laughing fits. I love all that so much. 

You're truly a great guy, and if you decide to hang it up, I'm grateful that I got to be a part of the community. 

wewI think what the second line is saying is that some crimes, they only occur because people break the commandments of "covet thy neighbors house and thy neighbor's wife." Basically saying that certain murders (perhaps the one in the red barn), occurred because of greed (coveting a neighbor's house) or an adulterous affair (coveting thy neighbor's wife).

I was confused by that lyric for a while, but after thinking of it like that, it's become one of my all time favorites by Tom.I dislike them just because they're so garish, but considering that they've never lost in them, I have developed a sick form of respect for them.

I'll say this in their favor: at least they're unique and interesting and trying something new. 

I mean, I'd rather have my team wear something so striking and weird like the hawks and the heat than say... [the wizards](https://www.nbajerseyfan.com/images/washington-wizards/bradley-beal-wizards-2020-21-gray-city-edition-jersey.jpg) or [the lions](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/938/276/9276938.jpg). Those are genuinely embarrassing with how unbelievably boring they are.This is not the game you wanted, but it's the game you deserve.

Think about it. 

In the midst of a pandemic and political strife you have spent so much time watching sports to distract you from the terrible reality we all share. Don't mistake my words of contempt as
some snipes from a faux moral high ground, I have done the same.

But isn't this the perfect game to end this season? To punish us? To wake us up from these pleasant distractions with a pill so bitter you instinctively choke on it?

You can rationalize it. You can outright hate it. You can curse and scream and rant all you want. But you can't defeat it. This game happened. It happened and it mattered and millions upon
millions of people watched it. You watched it. You spent a portion of the fleeting moments of your life, whether it be your youth, or the last remnants of your golden years, on this game.

2020 deserved this game. The league deserved this game. But most of all, you deserved this game.A hard truth that we have to accept as sixers fans is that the reason the NBA was able to get away with that (the above commenter didn't even know what you were referencing) is because nobody likes Philly. No one sympathizes with the team despite undergoing an unprecedented level of tampering by the league the likes of which have never been done on such a public scale.

It's a fact that if a team like the lakers did what Hinkie did, the NBA would be selling officially licensed "Trust the Process" merch, rather than forcing the GM out and installing a puppet to destroy the team from within. It's an open secret that NBA teams have different rules for the 'heroes' and the 'villains.'And sometimes not so subtly. Remember when the NBA's official magazine airbrushed Iverson's tattoos and jewelry out because they were too scared of a 'hood' athlete?

Iverson deserves to be remembered as a vanguard for player's rights to express their personality. Soooo many players today would not be able to wear the things they want, have tattoos, or even style their hair a particular way if Iverson didn't take so much heat for it back when he came into the league. Dude was a trailblazer.As much as I love Philly's energy, it can get hot a bit too quickly.

Around this time last year I was walking down the street wearing a [Celtic FC scarf](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eQqe9ZFmL._AC_SX450_.jpg) and these 3 drunks just started cursing me out and told me to fuck off back to Boston. I was too stunned to reply that I hate the Boston Celtics and that my scarf was for a soccer team from Glasgow in Scotland.McNabb is by far the most accomplished and for that reason he's the GOAT eagles QB. But I will make an argument for Cunningham being the most talented eagles QB, although he was well before my time. What he did with two head coaches who did not give a shit about offense (Ryan was far more defensive minded and Kotite was completely empty-minded) was nothing short of miraculous. 

I think it's like comparing Brady to Rodgers. Brady is obviously the most accomplished QB in NFL history but Rodgers might be more talented but just on worse teams with a far inferior head coach. You get into the argument of hypothetical GOAT and evidence-based GOAT and I think there's valid opinions on both sides. But just something to think about, what if Cunningham was coached by Andy instead of Buddy Ryan and Rich Kotite, the latter of whom is often ranked as one of the all time worst head coaches in NFL history. Just food for thought.I've been championing Bradley since the draft. I think he has the makings of a very solid LB with a huge upside. He's a great tackler, got some nice speed (watch on punts / kicks, he's always one of the first 3 guys to the returner), and seems to be incredibly quick-thinking especially in the heat of the moment. The final point is what really sells him for me. A lot of people can look at film and tell what a player is supposed to do, but only a truly intelligent player can make a correct decision when he has just a single moment to do so. If you hesitate, it's gone forever and you just blew it big time for your team. Bradley makes the right decisions without a moment's hesitation.

The fact that he's a rookie and has that strong of a mental game is extremely promising. 

Keep an eye out for 54. He's coming.People always pull out stats of how CBs leave his schemes and do better. While not acknowledging that those CBs, who had to play CB1 or CB2 here, are now playing depth and don't have to cover players of the caliber they faced when they were our number 1 corner. Like, what former eagle is currently the number 1 corner on their team right now? Because I can't think of any.

Turns out when your new team assigns you to cover players who aren't as good as the players you were tasked with covering on your old team, you suddenly play better!I 100% agree with what you said about how his statement was so dismissive of the really serious issue of anti-Semitism. I lost a huge amount of respect for him when I saw that video. It really upset me because he was my favorite player, not just for on-field reasons but for his off-field behavior, which I thought made him a paragon of social justice and reform.

Especially when you said "he blew it." I was waiting for days to get something from him, something powerful from a man that so many respect, and what came was a slap in the face.

I suppose I didn't think of it like that. Yes, what he said wasn't horrific like Jackson, but it was so dismissive that it allowed anti-Semitism to continue growing unfettered. There's a bit in this show that came out earlier this year *The Plot Against America,* where a terrible act of anti-Semitism occurs, and many people are waiting with bated breath for Lindbergh (who, in this alternate reality, won the Presidency over FDR) to speak out against it. And he said nothing. By doing nothing, he opened the doors for more hatred and violence. I really hope Jenkins has learned from this, because I so desperately want to believe he's a good man, and that he understands you can't just be impassive in the face of hatred, especially when it's coming from your movement.

Sorry for lumping you in with other people, that's on me. Your take is much more nuanced and similar to my own. Especially compared to a lot of the stuff that came out that week like people saying he was a "black supremacist" and stuff like that. But really those people didn't care about the plight of anti-Semitism in our country, they were just trying to take a faux moral highground against BLM.

And in regards to the Schwartz thing, Schwartz still criticized Jenkins heavily for his statement, but just told people they were interpreting it incorrectly when Jenkins said "Jewish people are not our problem."I love Shaun Bradley. I'm so hoping he gets an increased role, he seems to play his heart out on special teams and I feel like, even with very limited snaps, he always seemed to make at least one nice play a game. 

Also, something I noticed watching special teams, he's always one of the first 3 people to the receiver on kicks / punts, at least it seems that way to me. The dude has a motor and is a good tackler.

Honestly, a LB corp made up of Edwards, Singleton, Riley, and Bradley is not that awful considering how cheap we're getting all 4 of them for. 

Plus, Bradley is a hometown kid playing for his childhood team, how can you not root for this guy?Wow...

I was just going to wait a few months until the bugs got fixed and then buy the game. But if William Gibson actually thinks the aesthetic is wrong I might just pass it all together. I know all the other stuff is really bad and a complete disgrace, but if William Gibson doesn't think it passes muster then that is by far the most searing indictment of the game.Sacks for dliners are kind of like wins for QBs. Like, there's definitely some correlation where REALLY good players amass sacks, but the game isn't all about getting sacks. Getting pressure, forcing the QB to hurryup and make a poor throw, or have to change his reads to the otherside of the field because the ball will get batted down. And of course, that's not even factoring in run defense, which is a whole nother beast.

It grinds my gears when people talk about how Hargrave is terrible because he only has 1.5 sacks, but he does a lot more that doesn't show up in a very surface level number.Firing any previously proven coach in the weirdest and most fucked up year of sports in our lifetime is incredibly stupid. Obviously, a lot of teams have adapted to and overcome the hardships of this season, but Doug deserves the benefit of the doubt that he has just been unable to cope with the extraneous circumstances of covid. That being said, if he still looks lost next season, he will definitely be on the hotseat.And the best defense in the league too lol. Offense gets a boost when you have great field position because your D gets turnovers and consistently forces 3 and outs so you get to start at the 40.

Funny, when we had the best D in the league, we also were doing really well. Maybe the game is more about having an outstanding defense and an average to just above average offense these days.Difference is, those receivers get blown the fuck up every single game. I will never question the toughness of any NFL player, except maybe some kickers. The amount of pain those guys go through would destroy anyone else and I can't help but admire their toughness.

Like, I genuinely found McCown's performance in that terrible Seattle game so inspiring and use it to push myself every day. Dude was 40 years old, in an impossible game, suffering a torn hamstring, and still fighting like his life depended on it. As unathletic as he was that day, he was an icon of sportsmanship and it's obvious why he's so beloved.It really is entertaining how soccer players and basketball players constantly battle back and forth over who can be the most embarrassing floppers.

Union didn't deserve to win but the way the revs played show exactly why soccer will never be a top sport in North America, unless of course MLS actually does something about flopping. In a market where we have football players and hockey players fighting through so much pain, no one will respect guys who go down and grab the wrong leg that was supposedly injured.Using one of the most horrific acts of police brutality and lack of accountability as a gotcha is just pathetic. You're reducing the national crisis of police violence to a city-specific incident so you can dunk on a fanbase you don't like. Go after the actual fans, there's enough material for you to do so without giving a pass to cops.

That's just sad.I'm an American and my friends have spent the past few years shittalking me for being a SPFL fan since it's a "farmer league." Fucking hilarious how so many of them are now talking about how Scotland "plays beautiful soccer," and they're all experts on Scotland's historic involvement in the global sport these past few days. 

Give it a couple weeks and they'll be back to whatever hot, continental European team is the talk of it all.I know there were a lot of goofballs in last year's bullpen, but don't you think we can chalk some of that up to the staff? I mean, we picked up guys who were supposed to be, at their worst, league average or just subpar, and when they came here they were indescribably awful. 

If that happened to one guy it could just be written off, but the fact that so many dudes who were at the very least decent came here and played the worst baseball in their careers inclines me to believe it's more on the staff than the individuals.With this possibly being the last we ever hear of Ben DiNucci, I would like to remember my favorite analysis of this modern day Gaius Appuleius Diocles:


>[DaNucci is such a meme. He's trying to play hero ball but he's a seventh round pick nobody who got in via nepotism, lost his college starting job to nate peterman, and has no talent. You ain't Mahomes dude, you look like a fool rolling out and "sidearming" it out of bounds on a 4th and 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/jmdt5e/game_thread_dallas_cowboys_25_at_philadelphia/gav4jw1/)

Thank you enlightening us with your words of wisdom. I spent a solid 10 minutes laughing reading that.The culture is showing signs of shifting towards basic human decency, but we've got to keep pushing it forward. It sucks having to admit that there is something deeply wrong with this sport we love, but it's a true sign of character that you're able to realize it and get on side. 

I do think that with the various social movements that have been happening recently, these practices are becoming more and more unacceptable. But in the end, if we're expecting kids to stand up to this horribly toxic culture by themselves, they don't have a chance. So we've got to be supportive of them and back them up, so nobody has to suffer through this alone again.

There will always be a horror story of someone being tormented and bullied by a psychopath, that's unfortunately human nature and not something we can ever truly get rid of. But those people have always been a rare and hateful few. Out of however many people, there's always going to be at least one sadistic bastard, unfortunately. It's the people who stand by and do nothing as it transpires, the otherwise good people, who we need to be concerned about.Wow! I've never even heard of this group before but I'm instantly into them, they've got a new fan in me! Tom Waits has to be one of the hardest and most intimidating artists to cover, since his songs are so soulful and unique that most covers just come across as cheap (see The Eagles version of Ol' 55). This was incredible, truly incredible.

From top to bottom, this is an outstanding version. Easily a top 5 cover of ANY Tom Waits song I've ever heard. I loved that they didn't just try and copy him tone for tone, since nobody will be able to match him like that, but instead reinvented it in their own unique way to imprint their personal artistic stylings on it.

God, that's amazing. I've got to listen to them more. Spinifex Gum. Keep an eye on them, everyone! They've got my ear, at least.Taylor seems to be decent and could be good in the future, but the guy I really want to see getting more snaps is Bradley. He's made big plays when he's given the chance, I hope the team gives him the nod for a more significant role in the future. 

I trust Taylor will develop well and be a great player in the future, but I think Bradley is ready NOW.Remember when Carson went down in 17, losing his almost guaranteed MVP season, and every single person in the league along with every media personality sent him well wishes? Cause I sure don't. I don't think Dak even said anything about it. This whole week of sending out grievances and consolations is just typical cowboys needing to be coddled by the league. 

I hate injuries to players, especially to good guys like Dak and Dalton, but it's karmic that cowboys fans have to suffer through this after all the shit they talked about Wentz. Extra odd too that they end up losing their QBs to a leg injury and a concussion from a dirty hit, just like how Wentz went out...I think for people who see movies as a fantasy escape, Cassavetes films are depressing because they're so real, to an uncomfortable degree. While I find them beautifully poetic tributes to the simple dramas of everyday people, the thing about Cassavetes, and what made him such a wonderful artist, is that everyone will see the films from their own personal viewpoints.

Having to deal with those trials and tribulations that are so common in everyday life can be bleak when put on the silver screen, especially when we're so used to seeing people win those battles, instead of having to make compromises with them like most of Cassavetes' characters inevitably do.And not to mention his drive. Read his bio if you haven't already. I think the NHL has one of the biggest burnout percentages in terms of draft just because most of the draftees are essentially just kids who got a big taste without realizing how much work they're going to have to put in. And then they have to go against fully grown men who will show them how little they know about the game and beat the breaks off them while doing it. It's easy for people who have had an easy road to call it quits when it gets tough, when it requires more effort than you've ever given in your life for anything, and you're asked to give that effort every single game...

Effort is not going to be a concern for Wisdom. He has and will continue to give every piece of himself to improve his game. If he burns out, I will be shocked.Oh Washington Football Team would never do such a thing... 

I mean, we all remember how RGIII was a cancerous presence who everyone hated and was totally selfish. And then the second he joins a new team, said team praises him as a good locker room guy with a serious drive to succeed and just a nice guy to be around. Totally not coincidental and definitely not a scapegoat from the real problems in the organization...

Now that they have a shiny new toy in Chase Young, they've got to direct the fans ire to someone else, and why not a sophomore QB in a position where nothing short of a generational talent would succeed?Maybe the same people who leaked all those negative stories about RGIII...

Isn't it funny how RGIII, when he was on WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, was this terrible team player who was super selfish and everyone hated him, and then once he leaves, he's a very respected member of whatever locker room he's in and everyone praises him?

Crazy isn't it, that when WASHINGTON FOOTBAL TEAM is bored with their new toy it turns out the toy was shit the whole time? Don't worry tho, the Snyderbots will be here shortly to inform everyone that it's the quarterbacks who are the problem...It's significantly easier to reschedule games in a baseball season when you can just stock 'em up with double headers. Can't do that in football. All it takes is the titans or steelers (or any team after their bye week) missing one more week due to covid and the whole thing gets royally fucked up.

Also, MLB had protocols in place for how to make up games lost due to covid. As far as I am aware, the NFL is playing this by ear right now.It was a decently fun game as a neutral fan but let's be honest, very low stakes for a primetime game. The browns are most likely only going for a wild card spot (not trying to shittalk, being an eagles fan this year I have no place to, just being pragmatic about the state of the division and the team), and the bengals aren't expected to be anything short of irrelevant. Hard to really invest in any narrative surrounding the game. 

That being said, Baker vs Burrow will be a lot of fun to watch for the next few years. It's about time we get a proper QB duel in Ohio.From this year: Capitals Rangers March 5th 2020

Crazy game. Can't say much about it without giving anything away. But you wouldn't believe me if I did tell you what happened.

From my team's recent history: Flyers Penguins Game 6 2012. 

Biased, obviously, but that is the perfect example of how brutal and intense that rivalry is. I can't remember who said it, but someone said it's the most brutal and bloody rivalry in sports that isn't political or sectarian in nature. Just a good ol fashioned bloodfeud. That whole series is IMO one of the best non-finals playoff series of the 2010s, edged out only by that insane Kings Blackhawks series in 2014.I got a question for any Cincinnati hockey fans in here. I know there's a bitter city rivalry between Cleveland and Cincinnati, so obviously you wouldn't root for each other's teams in any sport, so are the Blue Jackets considered neutral ground? Or does one fanbase lay claim to them and the other fanbase has to look elsewhere for hockey? This really interests me and I've been meaning to ask one of you guys about it for a while. 

I just like the idea of Columbus being a demilitarized zone between Cincinnati and Cleveland haha.

Also, just want to add, congrats on Joe Burrow! He's amazing, not looking forward to Sunday, that's for sure.Believe me, I know Bukowski was a piece of shit. I wouldn't even call myself a fan of his work, I've just read some of it and find some of what I've read to be good and very unique. But I don't see any of Bukowski's writings as glorifying either his character's or his own nasty traits. Bukowski was aware of his flaws and while he didn't do much to improve himself, he knew that those things made him a bad person. He never asked for sympathy or forgiveness, because he knew he'd done nothing to deserve them. 

I don't see any kind of lionization of himself in his work, if anything, his writings are almost a wicker man for him to burn in his place with his own self-loathing flame.

I've got no problem with criticizing Bukowski, and I do it often myself. But this post and the majority of the comments here are just so anti-intellectual and willfully ignorant I had to speak up about it.Yes, Chinaski is a racist and an all around bastard. If you'd actually read the book you'd see that's a pretty significant part of his character and the reader is supposed to think critically (Difficult, I know!) and understand that his racism, misogyny, and other disgusting character traits are being criticized. Chinaski, like much of Bukowski's characters, are not intended to be sympathetic, merely pitiable. 

If you think he's a gross racist from this passage, congratulations, you've understood the point of it.Okay friends, so I'm at a bit of a dilemma. At the start of the season, I caught every single Bryce at bat, EXCEPT the ones where he actually did stuff. It wasn't until like week 3 or 4 that I actually saw Bryce do something live.

During his slump I've managed to catch almost all of his at bats. Except tonight, which I couldn't watch. I just pulled up the score and saw he homered twice this game. What do I do, guys.I have come to the conclusion that there is no promised land for Philadelphia sports. "Maybe next year," is the biggest lie we've ever told ourselves as fans. We're waiting for a moment that will never come when some great sports deity descends to the earth to carry all our teams to contender territory. It just ain't happening, baby.

Now, all that being said, is it concerning that I'm still gonna be cheering 'em on next year and be absolutely certain every team wins their respective championship until they're mathematically eliminated? Because I damn sure will be doing that until I die. And maybe even after, depending on your philosophies.Cassavetes is still to this day, the most uncompromising filmmaker in American history, in my opinion at least. He risked everything making his movies, nearly getting blacklisted for his first because it featured an interracial couple. Every single production risked bankruptcy. But he kept making them. 

Considering he pretty much singlehandedly created the indie film scene in America, he is nowhere near as appreciated as he should be. It's almost a guarantee that indie film doesn't exist, or at the very least isn't as popular as it is today, in America without him. For that reason, he will forever be my favorite filmmaker. 

The story of Cassavetes breaking down and crying on set as he's trying to explain the motivation of Cosmo in *The Killing of a Chinese Bookie* to Gazzara moves me every time I read it.

Also, it wouldn't surprise me at all if much of Scorsese's anti-marvel views originated from Cassavetes' own anti-Hollywood sentiments.Stephen A Smith is exactly the kind of quality person I love in broadcasting. He can be silly and clown around and make hot takes, which are fun to watch and talk about. But, when he needs to, he speaks so powerfully and wisely on serious subjects that he clearly commands the respect of everyone in the room and everyone watching. 

Just such a great gift to the world of sports. We need more people emulating him rather than Skip.It was bilachat, which is supposedly open to all fanbases. I was talking about the phillies with someone else, someone else said "phillies fans suck" and I responded with [an airhorn gif](https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-16-2016/NPl-wV.gif). Then both the other philly fan and I were banned for spamming. I didn't go into a sub to troll, I'm not a complete idiot.How could they have not gotten this message? The sobbing of the crocodile tears are so loud the whole world got the message that blegans literally want to destroy the indigenous way of life and that the noble twitter users who continue to support industries that deforest the land they depend on, mass exterminate the animals they need to live, and poison the water from which they drink are the ones who are REALLY looking out for their interests. And definitely not because they want to keep stuffing their deformed faces with processed meat and cow juice while browsing the internet looking for fringe causes to grandstand on without making any real impact that would require even the slightest inconvenience for themselves.Loba one is just kinda the same suggestion post regarding buffing the bracelet over and over, but the mirage one is really funny and I've actually learned a good amount from it. I just started and I'm not too in love with the idea of buying legends, so I'm trying to decide who to get for my next legend (when I get enough levels) and the mirage sub is leaning on me pretty hard to get him.I also think another benefit to bringing in Wilson is he'll be a great teacher for our extremely young LB corps.

Wilson has more than double the number of games played than our next closest LB, and although Singleton is older than him, Wilson has played his entire career in the big leagues, fighting for his spot as a UDFA. I imagine he'll be a great guiding force for Bradley and Taylor, both of whom (the former especially) I'm very excited for.

Losing experienced guys like Grugier-Hill, Riley, Bradham, and Jenkins (who basically flexed to linebacker on some snaps) definitely brought some concerns, but hopefully our linebackers can see some nice development this year.They are arguably the worst team since the pre-Crosby penguins (only difference being there isn't a consensus #1 overall pick projected to be a generational talent in the draft) with one of the worst prospect pools in the league in a year where scouting draftees is a complete guess so even if they get the #1 pick (it's lottery so they could miss), there's no guarantees they get the right player. 

The only way they could possibly be in a worse position is if the NHL was a non-salary cap league like the MLB.I highkey love the idea of these two kids being super grizzled and jaded mets superfans who act like 40-somethings who are old enough to remember decades of long island sports related trauma, but too young to remember a world series win.

Is that a concept for a comedy show already? Because if not, I'm willing to entertain some offers here. I think this thing has legs.It's like how people shit-talked the warriors, eagles, and all the other teams that refused the visit to the White House. "If you really cared and wanted to get something done, you would have gone and had a discussion with Trump!" As if Trump would have done anything but take a photo, shake hands, make some bizarre speech about how he is persecuted, or [do whatever the hell this is](https://i.imgur.com/u7mB7hU.png), before laughing at them and dropping out to make his tee time.You'll probably like Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus and Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! if you're into that 2000s indie sound.

I always struggle to recommend the "Synth Trilogy" (Push the Sky Away, Skeleton Tree, and Ghosteen), since the content of those albums is so heavy, while also being pretty distinct from a lot of his other work in terms of the instruments and sounds, but they are truly some of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.

The 2nd and 3rd albums (Skeleton Tree and Ghosteen) revolve around the tragic death of one of his teenage sons and are a very intense meditation on living with grief. So I highly recommend them as I consider the whole trilogy to be one of the finest achievements in music (and I would say try to listen to them concurrently if possible, but they are around 2.5 hours total so that's not always feasible), but with the warning that they get as dark as you can possible imagine, and perhaps even darker.For the past few years I've been sending letters to a player, simply requesting a nice game of catch. But he hasn't responded A SINGLE TIME. I don't understand, I think he and I are so alike, and I've told him multiple times how much I love his hair and how fast he runs. I don't think he's gotten any of my letters, which is a shame, because I'm sure our relationship would be a real home run!Just ignoring that the designer, Frehley loves nazi memorabilia and that almost certainly influenced his design? Here's another photo of two members of Kiss wearing some... [interesting outfits](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ksay9fWFUB1qao0pno1_400.jpg). And by the way, the guy on the right is Stanley (who is Jewish), who levied the accusations against Frehley and Criss. He clearly was okay with nazi imagery at the time when the band was a monstrous success, same way plenty of players in pro sports silently tolerate their teammates bigotry while playing beside them. 

And saying that Simmons and Stanley continuing to deny the logo's potential nazi origins isn't as big of a shutdown as you think it is. This band is the biggest sellout in the history of bands selling out. They sell kiss-labeled merchandise EVERYTHING. You can even get a kiss coffin. You'd be crazy to want to destroy your brand by confirming that the logo, which is bringing in million and millions of dollars by itself, is a nazi image. 

There were a lot of rock bands in the 70s that borrowed nazi imagery for their designs, another notable example being Motorhead, whose designer, Lemmy, [is also fond of nazi memorabilia.](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c7/a0/d3/c7a0d3294dd2986aeed0612b9350499b.jpg)

>From the beginning of time, the bad guys always had the best uniforms. Napoleon, the Confederates, the Nazis. They all had killer uniforms. I mean, the SS uniform is fucking brilliant! They were the rock stars of that time. What you're gonna do? They just look good

[From an interview with Lemmy](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/11/news.culture). 

So many rock bands were trying to be edgy rebels in the 70s, its not a stretch of the imagination that Kiss, like many others, drew from nazi imagery for their logo.So last year, the NFC East division was BAD, like REALLY BAD. By the final week of the regular season, the eagles were already out and had nothing to play for. However, their final game of the season was against WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, and because the giants had won their game against the cowboys earlier that day, the eagles effectively decided who would go into the playoffs. If they beat the WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, then the giants would go, if they lost then WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM would advance. 

About 3/4 of the way through the game, the eagles are only 3 points behind, when they seemingly randomly decide to pull their starting QB, Jalen Hurts, for a less than stellar 3rd stringer, Nate Sudfeld. While Doug Pederson (the recently fired coach of the eagles) had said they were going to give Sudfeld some playing time, there were many who cried foul that the eagles were intentionally trying to lose, which they did. Sudfeld looked absolutely awful and it was clearly not a decision made with any intention to win. Plenty of teams do this in the final few weeks of the season and most of the time it goes without any noise. But, because this decision kept the giants out of the playoffs, NY sports media had a meltdown of incredible proportions. 

While they were mostly just rants made by lunatic fans who probably forgot about it in a week or so, there were some very funny incidents. Like people saying that Pederson got paid off by WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM to throw the game, or that the eagles should be investigated and stripped of picks for 'disrespecting the league' by tanking. [And all of this was further stoked by giants players and their coaching staff complaining on twitter and in pressers](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-players-are-furious-on-twitter-after-eagles-bench-jalen-hurts-vs-washington/). Plus, there's the whole NYC - Philly rivalry which goes back generations before you and I were born.

I was just poking fun and trying to do some lighthearted jabbing btw, not trying to start any serious flame war.Huh, that surprises me. I would have figured our worst would be Kotite, but I suppose he was carried by Cunningham's amazing ability and one of the best d-lines of the 90s to an at least mediocre record. Even though he was fired years before I was born, I still think about that "Hey, 8-8 is great" quote when he had one of the most talented QBs of all time in his prime and I start to get angry.There's this one picture of Dick Allen, a recently passed MLB player who will likely be in the Hall of Fame next go around, that was being taken at the stadium for his rookie baseball card. While the picture was being taken, some fans were screaming the n-word at him, and you can just see the weariness in his eyes, knowing he has put up with this his whole life and will have to do so for the rest of his career. The abuse was so bad, he wore his batting helmet while fielding, which is extremely uncommon, just to protect himself from the things people threw at him. 

I think about that picture a lot, and wish it and all the others like it were just a relic of the 1960s when sports, at least here in America, were still in the infancy stages of integration. It's easy to think that things are better, and maybe in a lot of ways they are, but there's still so much ground to cover, I don't know if we'll get through this in my lifetime.[Last summer in Philadelphia, there was the largest BLM rally in the entire country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwtZKsBJmyA), with massive protests all across the city. On the other side of the state of Pennsylvania, in Allegheny County (About 500 KM) away, there were almost no protests to speak of. 

And yet, Philadelphia, which is a far larger and more densely populated region than Allegheny County, had significantly less covid cases per capita during that time. Some speculate this is because Philadelphia has the [highest percentage of mask-wearing individuals of any major city in the entire country](https://billypenn.com/2020/07/19/philly-mask-compliance-high-coronavirus-cdc-director-mandatatory/), whereas Allegheny County... they do not.

-San Patricio by The ChieftainsI think we should give KD the benefit of the doubt since he did end up unliking the post. It's very possible he just liked it without actually reading or watching the clip. Hell, before this whole thing blew up and when I followed Jackson on instagram (emphasis on when), I almost liked that video of Farrakhan just out of habit. And I've hated Farrakhan for years, I just didn't recognize him and saw it on my feed. I follow less than 100 people, KD follows thousands, it's genuinely possible he just didn't notice it and was liking something one of his friends posted. And this is coming from a certified KD hater and a diehard fan of a rival team.This season peaked for me as a Celtic fan with that video of someone crashing a plane into Ibrox on Flight Sim. 

That video was released before a single game was played.

 I am a hollow man these days and the only way I can get a sense of meager joy is by scoffing at Rangers fans celebrating. Don't take the only remaining good thing left in my life, please.I 100% agree that it was gross how they gave him a 'rockstar' treatment, but I feel his fate somewhat redeems it. Trapped in a summer camp to be tortured and killed by his victims for all of eternity seems like a pretty fitting end for such a horrible human being. 

I do wish they gave us more catharsis and focused on how he was essentially in Hell being punished for his sins, but it did go a long way to washing the bitter taste from my mouth.I meant more like he'll be invited for a permanent role rather than just a stand-in for an injured / protocoled player. I doubt he'll be invited for the starting roster next year but I am very confident he'll be in the starting 22 within 3 years.  I definitely think he'll be in the next batch of callups if (hopefully not when) the next outbreak occurs.I'll admit I'm not familiar with the LA sports scene from anything but my east coast perspective, so I just assumed that people are fans of either the premier team or the secondary teams with no intermingling.

At least, that's how I would be were I an LA sports fan. If I were an angels fan I wouldn't want to support the team that is mostly dodgers fans.

I love hearing about fandom divides, what teams are considered "common ground" for bitter, blood rivals is really interesting. It's unfortunately a small market so it's not talked about that much, but it's interesting how Cincinnati and Cleveland kind of treat the Blue Jackets as a demilitarized zone between their bitterly rivaled cities.The craziest thing about Gretzky is he retired relatively early too! He was embarrassed that people were clearly avoiding hitting him as no one wanted to be the guy who ended the career of The Great One. He felt that if he kept playing he would be hurting the integrity of the sport, so he gave it up when he still had more in the tank. He reasonably could have kept playing for several more years, and while he was past his peak, he was still easily a top tier player at the time of his retirement.

His records could have truly been untouchable if he kept playing until he physically couldn't anymore.Duce is a great one. His ability to develop running backs is crazy strong. 

I remember the first few weeks of the 2019 season, many fans were complaining about Miles Sanders being a bust. After Duce worked with him, Sanders became a top 5 RB in the league. 

He turned Corey Clement into a massive contributor to a Super Bowl winner. He turned Boston Scott into a known name. He turned a rotation of Josh Adams / Wendell Smallwood into a playoff winner. One of the most underrated assistant coaches in the NFC.

I'm so happy he ended up with you guys, the lions are my second team in the NFC and I'm thrilled to see how he does with you. 

You're going to love him.I just like all of Detroit's teams. Red Wings, Tigers, Pistons, and Lions. They're my second team in every sport.

I like their history, which is often tragic and full of grit. They're a classic underdog who you always want to root for. Also, I see a lot of similarities between them and Philadelphia with the cities being unfairly maligned and picked on with lazy, cheap shots. 

When a fanbase / city is being mocked, they are essentially split up into two groups. The first being those that give in and whine, hoping to be so pathetic and pitiable people leave them alone (Minneapolis). The second being those that close ranks and rally together to protect the pride of their city.

Detroit falls firmly into the latter category, in my opinion. They make a good story of people who, even with all the odds against them, still believe in those three magical words: "maybe next year."Did he actually have a testicular contusion that put him in the hospital and required immediate treatment? That's not just getting hit in the balls, that's getting hit so hard that the entire sack starts swelling and doctors have to intervene to save it.

Plenty of MLB players get hit in the balls at some point, and many stay in. [Here's Didi Gregorius getting a bouncing ball to the donger](https://imgur.com/IRZ7j3x) and then he proceeds to [avenge his peen the very next inning](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/934a5658-ac9f-49d0-aa9b-8145e70f42c7.mp4)This is what I find truly frightening about Gritty.

We have no idea who the guy is. We all know who the phanatic is played by, as well as most other mascots, we have zero idea who plays Gritty. But, whoever they rare, they're incredibly athletic. 

[They can run very quickly in that suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M96PnqXYaf4)

[They're an incredibly good skater](https://youtu.be/-axO798ht4Y?t=93)

And just being generally rather nimble with climbing over seats, throwing things at people, and they've got one hell of a right hook, as that uppity 12 year old is now aware.

And, it turns out, they've got a strong golf drive.

Also, I vaguely recall someone posting some  analysis of the costume saying that the person inside of it has to be at least 6'5" and very strong to be able to move that suit so gracefully. 
 
The mystery of Gritty is by far the most disturbing part of him. What kind of person possesses all those skills and what other abilities do they have hidden within them. The only way to avoid genuinely fearing Gritty is to worship him.I think there are circumstances where it's appropriate to be angry at a player for getting a massive contract and then just not trying at all. That has never applied to Tobi or even Horford, for that matter. For however bad those two were, even the latter, they always seemed to be putting in the effort and trying their best. Especially with the amount of hate Tobi got, it's very admirable that he shut it all out and focused on improving his game to the highest degree.

Hell, I remember there were some fans who were making jokes after that scary head injury he had back in the bubble. It takes a person of high character to go out and play your hardest knowing you're playing for those scumfuck's entertainment.

That's the kind of athlete that will THRIVE in Philly.Unrelated, but I absolutely adore those away whites for Montreal. They're so nice, the blue stripe combined with the blue pants and the red shoulders are just perfection. I don't know if this makes sense, but that jersey just "feels" like Montreal. Artistic, minimalist, and extremely tasteful. They're honestly my favorite current jersey in the league, although the flyers winter classic from 2012 still holds the title for favorite.

If they ever change it, I'm knocking Montreal up to a top 5 hated team.Thank you so much, sir. I hope you know how much everyone loves you and the awesome community you've essentially created from nothing. 

I'm an out of market fan and I've actually never met another flyers fan (outside of family and visits to Philly, that is), so the chat is to me the equivalent of watching games with buds who also care about the team and develop their own mannerisms and jokes related to the flyers.

I owe you that. I don't think I would have been able to sustain my passion without that awesome chat. I love that some bongos can get my heart racing, and the mere mention of a certain NASCAR driver can send me into unexplainable laughing fits. I love all that so much. 

You're truly a great guy, and if you decide to hang it up, I'm grateful that I got to be a part of the community. 

wewI think what the second line is saying is that some crimes, they only occur because people break the commandments of "covet thy neighbors house and thy neighbor's wife." Basically saying that certain murders (perhaps the one in the red barn), occurred because of greed (coveting a neighbor's house) or an adulterous affair (coveting thy neighbor's wife).

I was confused by that lyric for a while, but after thinking of it like that, it's become one of my all time favorites by Tom.I dislike them just because they're so garish, but considering that they've never lost in them, I have developed a sick form of respect for them.

I'll say this in their favor: at least they're unique and interesting and trying something new. 

I mean, I'd rather have my team wear something so striking and weird like the hawks and the heat than say... [the wizards](https://www.nbajerseyfan.com/images/washington-wizards/bradley-beal-wizards-2020-21-gray-city-edition-jersey.jpg) or [the lions](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/938/276/9276938.jpg). Those are genuinely embarrassing with how unbelievably boring they are.This is not the game you wanted, but it's the game you deserve.

Think about it. 

In the midst of a pandemic and political strife you have spent so much time watching sports to distract you from the terrible reality we all share. Don't mistake my words of contempt as
some snipes from a faux moral high ground, I have done the same.

But isn't this the perfect game to end this season? To punish us? To wake us up from these pleasant distractions with a pill so bitter you instinctively choke on it?

You can rationalize it. You can outright hate it. You can curse and scream and rant all you want. But you can't defeat it. This game happened. It happened and it mattered and millions upon
millions of people watched it. You watched it. You spent a portion of the fleeting moments of your life, whether it be your youth, or the last remnants of your golden years, on this game.

2020 deserved this game. The league deserved this game. But most of all, you deserved this game.A hard truth that we have to accept as sixers fans is that the reason the NBA was able to get away with that (the above commenter didn't even know what you were referencing) is because nobody likes Philly. No one sympathizes with the team despite undergoing an unprecedented level of tampering by the league the likes of which have never been done on such a public scale.

It's a fact that if a team like the lakers did what Hinkie did, the NBA would be selling officially licensed "Trust the Process" merch, rather than forcing the GM out and installing a puppet to destroy the team from within. It's an open secret that NBA teams have different rules for the 'heroes' and the 'villains.'And sometimes not so subtly. Remember when the NBA's official magazine airbrushed Iverson's tattoos and jewelry out because they were too scared of a 'hood' athlete?

Iverson deserves to be remembered as a vanguard for player's rights to express their personality. Soooo many players today would not be able to wear the things they want, have tattoos, or even style their hair a particular way if Iverson didn't take so much heat for it back when he came into the league. Dude was a trailblazer.As much as I love Philly's energy, it can get hot a bit too quickly.

Around this time last year I was walking down the street wearing a [Celtic FC scarf](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eQqe9ZFmL._AC_SX450_.jpg) and these 3 drunks just started cursing me out and told me to fuck off back to Boston. I was too stunned to reply that I hate the Boston Celtics and that my scarf was for a soccer team from Glasgow in Scotland.McNabb is by far the most accomplished and for that reason he's the GOAT eagles QB. But I will make an argument for Cunningham being the most talented eagles QB, although he was well before my time. What he did with two head coaches who did not give a shit about offense (Ryan was far more defensive minded and Kotite was completely empty-minded) was nothing short of miraculous. 

I think it's like comparing Brady to Rodgers. Brady is obviously the most accomplished QB in NFL history but Rodgers might be more talented but just on worse teams with a far inferior head coach. You get into the argument of hypothetical GOAT and evidence-based GOAT and I think there's valid opinions on both sides. But just something to think about, what if Cunningham was coached by Andy instead of Buddy Ryan and Rich Kotite, the latter of whom is often ranked as one of the all time worst head coaches in NFL history. Just food for thought.I've been championing Bradley since the draft. I think he has the makings of a very solid LB with a huge upside. He's a great tackler, got some nice speed (watch on punts / kicks, he's always one of the first 3 guys to the returner), and seems to be incredibly quick-thinking especially in the heat of the moment. The final point is what really sells him for me. A lot of people can look at film and tell what a player is supposed to do, but only a truly intelligent player can make a correct decision when he has just a single moment to do so. If you hesitate, it's gone forever and you just blew it big time for your team. Bradley makes the right decisions without a moment's hesitation.

The fact that he's a rookie and has that strong of a mental game is extremely promising. 

Keep an eye out for 54. He's coming.People always pull out stats of how CBs leave his schemes and do better. While not acknowledging that those CBs, who had to play CB1 or CB2 here, are now playing depth and don't have to cover players of the caliber they faced when they were our number 1 corner. Like, what former eagle is currently the number 1 corner on their team right now? Because I can't think of any.

Turns out when your new team assigns you to cover players who aren't as good as the players you were tasked with covering on your old team, you suddenly play better!I 100% agree with what you said about how his statement was so dismissive of the really serious issue of anti-Semitism. I lost a huge amount of respect for him when I saw that video. It really upset me because he was my favorite player, not just for on-field reasons but for his off-field behavior, which I thought made him a paragon of social justice and reform.

Especially when you said "he blew it." I was waiting for days to get something from him, something powerful from a man that so many respect, and what came was a slap in the face.

I suppose I didn't think of it like that. Yes, what he said wasn't horrific like Jackson, but it was so dismissive that it allowed anti-Semitism to continue growing unfettered. There's a bit in this show that came out earlier this year *The Plot Against America,* where a terrible act of anti-Semitism occurs, and many people are waiting with bated breath for Lindbergh (who, in this alternate reality, won the Presidency over FDR) to speak out against it. And he said nothing. By doing nothing, he opened the doors for more hatred and violence. I really hope Jenkins has learned from this, because I so desperately want to believe he's a good man, and that he understands you can't just be impassive in the face of hatred, especially when it's coming from your movement.

Sorry for lumping you in with other people, that's on me. Your take is much more nuanced and similar to my own. Especially compared to a lot of the stuff that came out that week like people saying he was a "black supremacist" and stuff like that. But really those people didn't care about the plight of anti-Semitism in our country, they were just trying to take a faux moral highground against BLM.

And in regards to the Schwartz thing, Schwartz still criticized Jenkins heavily for his statement, but just told people they were interpreting it incorrectly when Jenkins said "Jewish people are not our problem."I love Shaun Bradley. I'm so hoping he gets an increased role, he seems to play his heart out on special teams and I feel like, even with very limited snaps, he always seemed to make at least one nice play a game. 

Also, something I noticed watching special teams, he's always one of the first 3 people to the receiver on kicks / punts, at least it seems that way to me. The dude has a motor and is a good tackler.

Honestly, a LB corp made up of Edwards, Singleton, Riley, and Bradley is not that awful considering how cheap we're getting all 4 of them for. 

Plus, Bradley is a hometown kid playing for his childhood team, how can you not root for this guy?Wow...

I was just going to wait a few months until the bugs got fixed and then buy the game. But if William Gibson actually thinks the aesthetic is wrong I might just pass it all together. I know all the other stuff is really bad and a complete disgrace, but if William Gibson doesn't think it passes muster then that is by far the most searing indictment of the game.Sacks for dliners are kind of like wins for QBs. Like, there's definitely some correlation where REALLY good players amass sacks, but the game isn't all about getting sacks. Getting pressure, forcing the QB to hurryup and make a poor throw, or have to change his reads to the otherside of the field because the ball will get batted down. And of course, that's not even factoring in run defense, which is a whole nother beast.

It grinds my gears when people talk about how Hargrave is terrible because he only has 1.5 sacks, but he does a lot more that doesn't show up in a very surface level number.Firing any previously proven coach in the weirdest and most fucked up year of sports in our lifetime is incredibly stupid. Obviously, a lot of teams have adapted to and overcome the hardships of this season, but Doug deserves the benefit of the doubt that he has just been unable to cope with the extraneous circumstances of covid. That being said, if he still looks lost next season, he will definitely be on the hotseat.And the best defense in the league too lol. Offense gets a boost when you have great field position because your D gets turnovers and consistently forces 3 and outs so you get to start at the 40.

Funny, when we had the best D in the league, we also were doing really well. Maybe the game is more about having an outstanding defense and an average to just above average offense these days.Difference is, those receivers get blown the fuck up every single game. I will never question the toughness of any NFL player, except maybe some kickers. The amount of pain those guys go through would destroy anyone else and I can't help but admire their toughness.

Like, I genuinely found McCown's performance in that terrible Seattle game so inspiring and use it to push myself every day. Dude was 40 years old, in an impossible game, suffering a torn hamstring, and still fighting like his life depended on it. As unathletic as he was that day, he was an icon of sportsmanship and it's obvious why he's so beloved.It really is entertaining how soccer players and basketball players constantly battle back and forth over who can be the most embarrassing floppers.

Union didn't deserve to win but the way the revs played show exactly why soccer will never be a top sport in North America, unless of course MLS actually does something about flopping. In a market where we have football players and hockey players fighting through so much pain, no one will respect guys who go down and grab the wrong leg that was supposedly injured.Using one of the most horrific acts of police brutality and lack of accountability as a gotcha is just pathetic. You're reducing the national crisis of police violence to a city-specific incident so you can dunk on a fanbase you don't like. Go after the actual fans, there's enough material for you to do so without giving a pass to cops.

That's just sad.I'm an American and my friends have spent the past few years shittalking me for being a SPFL fan since it's a "farmer league." Fucking hilarious how so many of them are now talking about how Scotland "plays beautiful soccer," and they're all experts on Scotland's historic involvement in the global sport these past few days. 

Give it a couple weeks and they'll be back to whatever hot, continental European team is the talk of it all.I know there were a lot of goofballs in last year's bullpen, but don't you think we can chalk some of that up to the staff? I mean, we picked up guys who were supposed to be, at their worst, league average or just subpar, and when they came here they were indescribably awful. 

If that happened to one guy it could just be written off, but the fact that so many dudes who were at the very least decent came here and played the worst baseball in their careers inclines me to believe it's more on the staff than the individuals.With this possibly being the last we ever hear of Ben DiNucci, I would like to remember my favorite analysis of this modern day Gaius Appuleius Diocles:


>[DaNucci is such a meme. He's trying to play hero ball but he's a seventh round pick nobody who got in via nepotism, lost his college starting job to nate peterman, and has no talent. You ain't Mahomes dude, you look like a fool rolling out and "sidearming" it out of bounds on a 4th and 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/jmdt5e/game_thread_dallas_cowboys_25_at_philadelphia/gav4jw1/)

Thank you enlightening us with your words of wisdom. I spent a solid 10 minutes laughing reading that.The culture is showing signs of shifting towards basic human decency, but we've got to keep pushing it forward. It sucks having to admit that there is something deeply wrong with this sport we love, but it's a true sign of character that you're able to realize it and get on side. 

I do think that with the various social movements that have been happening recently, these practices are becoming more and more unacceptable. But in the end, if we're expecting kids to stand up to this horribly toxic culture by themselves, they don't have a chance. So we've got to be supportive of them and back them up, so nobody has to suffer through this alone again.

There will always be a horror story of someone being tormented and bullied by a psychopath, that's unfortunately human nature and not something we can ever truly get rid of. But those people have always been a rare and hateful few. Out of however many people, there's always going to be at least one sadistic bastard, unfortunately. It's the people who stand by and do nothing as it transpires, the otherwise good people, who we need to be concerned about.Wow! I've never even heard of this group before but I'm instantly into them, they've got a new fan in me! Tom Waits has to be one of the hardest and most intimidating artists to cover, since his songs are so soulful and unique that most covers just come across as cheap (see The Eagles version of Ol' 55). This was incredible, truly incredible.

From top to bottom, this is an outstanding version. Easily a top 5 cover of ANY Tom Waits song I've ever heard. I loved that they didn't just try and copy him tone for tone, since nobody will be able to match him like that, but instead reinvented it in their own unique way to imprint their personal artistic stylings on it.

God, that's amazing. I've got to listen to them more. Spinifex Gum. Keep an eye on them, everyone! They've got my ear, at least.Taylor seems to be decent and could be good in the future, but the guy I really want to see getting more snaps is Bradley. He's made big plays when he's given the chance, I hope the team gives him the nod for a more significant role in the future. 

I trust Taylor will develop well and be a great player in the future, but I think Bradley is ready NOW.Remember when Carson went down in 17, losing his almost guaranteed MVP season, and every single person in the league along with every media personality sent him well wishes? Cause I sure don't. I don't think Dak even said anything about it. This whole week of sending out grievances and consolations is just typical cowboys needing to be coddled by the league. 

I hate injuries to players, especially to good guys like Dak and Dalton, but it's karmic that cowboys fans have to suffer through this after all the shit they talked about Wentz. Extra odd too that they end up losing their QBs to a leg injury and a concussion from a dirty hit, just like how Wentz went out...I think for people who see movies as a fantasy escape, Cassavetes films are depressing because they're so real, to an uncomfortable degree. While I find them beautifully poetic tributes to the simple dramas of everyday people, the thing about Cassavetes, and what made him such a wonderful artist, is that everyone will see the films from their own personal viewpoints.

Having to deal with those trials and tribulations that are so common in everyday life can be bleak when put on the silver screen, especially when we're so used to seeing people win those battles, instead of having to make compromises with them like most of Cassavetes' characters inevitably do.And not to mention his drive. Read his bio if you haven't already. I think the NHL has one of the biggest burnout percentages in terms of draft just because most of the draftees are essentially just kids who got a big taste without realizing how much work they're going to have to put in. And then they have to go against fully grown men who will show them how little they know about the game and beat the breaks off them while doing it. It's easy for people who have had an easy road to call it quits when it gets tough, when it requires more effort than you've ever given in your life for anything, and you're asked to give that effort every single game...

Effort is not going to be a concern for Wisdom. He has and will continue to give every piece of himself to improve his game. If he burns out, I will be shocked.Oh Washington Football Team would never do such a thing... 

I mean, we all remember how RGIII was a cancerous presence who everyone hated and was totally selfish. And then the second he joins a new team, said team praises him as a good locker room guy with a serious drive to succeed and just a nice guy to be around. Totally not coincidental and definitely not a scapegoat from the real problems in the organization...

Now that they have a shiny new toy in Chase Young, they've got to direct the fans ire to someone else, and why not a sophomore QB in a position where nothing short of a generational talent would succeed?Maybe the same people who leaked all those negative stories about RGIII...

Isn't it funny how RGIII, when he was on WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM, was this terrible team player who was super selfish and everyone hated him, and then once he leaves, he's a very respected member of whatever locker room he's in and everyone praises him?

Crazy isn't it, that when WASHINGTON FOOTBAL TEAM is bored with their new toy it turns out the toy was shit the whole time? Don't worry tho, the Snyderbots will be here shortly to inform everyone that it's the quarterbacks who are the problem...It's significantly easier to reschedule games in a baseball season when you can just stock 'em up with double headers. Can't do that in football. All it takes is the titans or steelers (or any team after their bye week) missing one more week due to covid and the whole thing gets royally fucked up.

Also, MLB had protocols in place for how to make up games lost due to covid. As far as I am aware, the NFL is playing this by ear right now.It was a decently fun game as a neutral fan but let's be honest, very low stakes for a primetime game. The browns are most likely only going for a wild card spot (not trying to shittalk, being an eagles fan this year I have no place to, just being pragmatic about the state of the division and the team), and the bengals aren't expected to be anything short of irrelevant. Hard to really invest in any narrative surrounding the game. 

That being said, Baker vs Burrow will be a lot of fun to watch for the next few years. It's about time we get a proper QB duel in Ohio.From this year: Capitals Rangers March 5th 2020

Crazy game. Can't say much about it without giving anything away. But you wouldn't believe me if I did tell you what happened.

From my team's recent history: Flyers Penguins Game 6 2012. 

Biased, obviously, but that is the perfect example of how brutal and intense that rivalry is. I can't remember who said it, but someone said it's the most brutal and bloody rivalry in sports that isn't political or sectarian in nature. Just a good ol fashioned bloodfeud. That whole series is IMO one of the best non-finals playoff series of the 2010s, edged out only by that insane Kings Blackhawks series in 2014.I got a question for any Cincinnati hockey fans in here. I know there's a bitter city rivalry between Cleveland and Cincinnati, so obviously you wouldn't root for each other's teams in any sport, so are the Blue Jackets considered neutral ground? Or does one fanbase lay claim to them and the other fanbase has to look elsewhere for hockey? This really interests me and I've been meaning to ask one of you guys about it for a while. 

I just like the idea of Columbus being a demilitarized zone between Cincinnati and Cleveland haha.

Also, just want to add, congrats on Joe Burrow! He's amazing, not looking forward to Sunday, that's for sure.Believe me, I know Bukowski was a piece of shit. I wouldn't even call myself a fan of his work, I've just read some of it and find some of what I've read to be good and very unique. But I don't see any of Bukowski's writings as glorifying either his character's or his own nasty traits. Bukowski was aware of his flaws and while he didn't do much to improve himself, he knew that those things made him a bad person. He never asked for sympathy or forgiveness, because he knew he'd done nothing to deserve them. 

I don't see any kind of lionization of himself in his work, if anything, his writings are almost a wicker man for him to burn in his place with his own self-loathing flame.

I've got no problem with criticizing Bukowski, and I do it often myself. But this post and the majority of the comments here are just so anti-intellectual and willfully ignorant I had to speak up about it.Yes, Chinaski is a racist and an all around bastard. If you'd actually read the book you'd see that's a pretty significant part of his character and the reader is supposed to think critically (Difficult, I know!) and understand that his racism, misogyny, and other disgusting character traits are being criticized. Chinaski, like much of Bukowski's characters, are not intended to be sympathetic, merely pitiable. 

If you think he's a gross racist from this passage, congratulations, you've understood the point of it.Okay friends, so I'm at a bit of a dilemma. At the start of the season, I caught every single Bryce at bat, EXCEPT the ones where he actually did stuff. It wasn't until like week 3 or 4 that I actually saw Bryce do something live.

During his slump I've managed to catch almost all of his at bats. Except tonight, which I couldn't watch. I just pulled up the score and saw he homered twice this game. What do I do, guys.I have come to the conclusion that there is no promised land for Philadelphia sports. "Maybe next year," is the biggest lie we've ever told ourselves as fans. We're waiting for a moment that will never come when some great sports deity descends to the earth to carry all our teams to contender territory. It just ain't happening, baby.

Now, all that being said, is it concerning that I'm still gonna be cheering 'em on next year and be absolutely certain every team wins their respective championship until they're mathematically eliminated? Because I damn sure will be doing that until I die. And maybe even after, depending on your philosophies.Cassavetes is still to this day, the most uncompromising filmmaker in American history, in my opinion at least. He risked everything making his movies, nearly getting blacklisted for his first because it featured an interracial couple. Every single production risked bankruptcy. But he kept making them. 

Considering he pretty much singlehandedly created the indie film scene in America, he is nowhere near as appreciated as he should be. It's almost a guarantee that indie film doesn't exist, or at the very least isn't as popular as it is today, in America without him. For that reason, he will forever be my favorite filmmaker. 

The story of Cassavetes breaking down and crying on set as he's trying to explain the motivation of Cosmo in *The Killing of a Chinese Bookie* to Gazzara moves me every time I read it.

Also, it wouldn't surprise me at all if much of Scorsese's anti-marvel views originated from Cassavetes' own anti-Hollywood sentiments.Stephen A Smith is exactly the kind of quality person I love in broadcasting. He can be silly and clown around and make hot takes, which are fun to watch and talk about. But, when he needs to, he speaks so powerfully and wisely on serious subjects that he clearly commands the respect of everyone in the room and everyone watching. 

Just such a great gift to the world of sports. We need more people emulating him rather than Skip.It was bilachat, which is supposedly open to all fanbases. I was talking about the phillies with someone else, someone else said "phillies fans suck" and I responded with [an airhorn gif](https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-16-2016/NPl-wV.gif). Then both the other philly fan and I were banned for spamming. I didn't go into a sub to troll, I'm not a complete idiot.
