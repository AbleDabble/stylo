However, I realized in my mid 20s my issue was less about the criticism and more about the attitude and delivery of it.

 A lot of people dont know how to give constructive criticism and only know how to criticize using tones and language that comes off as rude, snarky, or as a downright attack. OfWas supervising pne night and a patron read my name tag and just went "Toadstool! YOU HOT you know that?"

Especially if I'm in a heightened emotional state. It kinda helps me navigate my emotional state and get it all out,  so to speak. Keeps me from bottling the emotions and having them come out at bad times. Think of the therapeutic use of a diary only I'm just expressing in the comfort of my own head.

So I blew up the customer service chat with more pictures and threats of legal action against the app itself for releasing the funds without contacting me first.

It's  very rare to be in a situation where spitting isn't wrong. 

If someone happens to get sick, I expect them to spit after puking or something. But spitting just to spit is gross and annoying. If you seriously feel the need to hock a lugie, go to the bathroom and do it. I can't stand that shit.
