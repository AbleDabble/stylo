I used to use a generic dog hammock for the back seat. They're pretty cheap on amazon. I ended up just shoving a crate into the car and using that (more safety), then the dog got too big and I used a Travall Guard in my Subaru Outback. With the MY, my pup is too big to try to climb into the back seat, but I will probably get a Variobarrier HR.

UltI don't know what I'm doing. I own a home, and I'm trying to remodel. I have a lender who is doing a cash-out refinance, an architect who says the project will work, a general contractor who just agrees with the architect, and some random people telling me the remodel is worth it.

Two years ago, I talked to 6 different architects and GC's, and theMaybe I'm doing it wrong:

1. Rinse with hose
2. Soap in bucket with a mit
3. Use the mit on the entire car
4. Use the mit on the rims last
5. Rinse with hose
6. Dry with a 8hp blower

If the car is really dirty:

1. Rinse with hose
2. Use the foam gun thing on the hose to douse the car with shampoo water
3. Use the mit on the entire car
4. Rinse wThat's beautiful, love the layers.

I went on Sunday, but left at sunset because I knew the rangers were going to kick us out. But we saw so many people still coming in and setting up on the hillside. I wish I had stayed, but I didn't want to add to the problem.

I'll try to look for another spot above the fog that's open in the evening.

Here's miYou know your pup, even if you’re far the dog is too excited and the reward is no longer you, it’s the person/dog. 

Give your dog plenty of time with the other person or dog, and start after they’re really tired. 

Another thing you can do is let your dog know that doing the right thing gives them the ultimate reward (going to the person). 

Have oh, this is extremely hard for any dog!

If you never train with two people in the same place, or another dog, you can't expect your pup to generalize perfectly.

Just like starting to do loose-leash in the house, we started doing loose-leash with two people involved indoors, then in the yard, and progressed to out on the street. After awhile she f&gt;\-Is the low suspension really a big deal, comfort-wise with regular highway driving?

The height with the performance package suspension is negligible, you would barely notice a difference, therefore there really isn't any difference with comfort on highway. I think you're thinking more about the spring rate/dampening rate, which really affectI posted almost the same ask. Dark roasts are your best bet, in fact, just go for French Roast and work your way up from there.

Stumptown's French Roast is probably the least "Dark" I've tried, and I'm a big fan of it now.

Other good ones that I like are Philz Tesora.

Counter Culture's 46 is not too dark and has no acidity, but it's kind of lackI got my delivery date scheduled, and then I emailed Tesla finance to redo the loan (the last one expired, since my delivery was supposed to be in April). It seemed like the delivery didn't care, as long as the money was paid right before I drove off.

I just paid through the web a day before my delivery. I figured, the worst case, I just cancel myI had the same. I had arranged a loan earlier in March, but because of SIP it expired. They could care less about what was going on with the loan and I setup delivery etc. without payment or the loan being active anymore.

I ultimately had to get the loan approved and all that before I got there, but yeah, they don't care about that when setting upI got my car on June 13, barley drove it 20 miles, and it's been at the service for a week. It only had minor issues, but they are pretty backed up and hopefully I can get my car back today. If so, I hope all my issues are solved and I can move on. But realistically, I could be looking at least at one more service for issues I find driving it more Yeah, I think the bottom line is:  


You'll get a car that is pretty much perfect, and there's no risk. You can always get your money back.

The only thing you lose is time/energy spent dealing with service and/or going through the return process (which is really just waiting).

Big upside: awesome car (eventually)  
Small downside: you got excite2019 Subaru Outback 3.6R Limited, 9,000 miles on it!

I love the car, but need to get out of our lease. It's with Chase, so there's no way to transfer it. The only way is to buy it out, but I don't have that liquid.

I tried using Swapalease, but they're listing it at an outrageous price, so nobody is buying.

Can I advertise on Craigslist at the bHah! Well here's how it usually goes:  


1. Park in the garage.
2. Grab the duster from the wall
3. Just go over the surface quickly. Takes one minute, maybe 2.

When I leave

1. Goto the garage
2. Grab the duster
3. Just go over the surface (1 - 2 minutes)
4. Put the duster back and leave

It's just a few more minutes before and after driving.

WI have a 2019 Outback and now the Model Y. I feel like I'm higher in the Model Y. But that's just a feeling, and could be because of the glass roof like someone else mentioned.

The cargo area is much smaller feeling, and it is because of the slope. I'm still waiting on weather mats from Tesmanian so I can test my dog in there, but she's probably gI think if you're not used to having a black car, owning one is really weird. But I don't know, it's just been part of owning a car, keeping it clean.

On my last car, it was fully wrapped in XPEL, and I would use one of those big car dusters on it every time I came home, and sometimes right before leaving the garage. And of course, garage. And theA few photos including all the issues I found:

So far:

1. Charge door does not close flush
2. Spoiler has not adhered on the left side
3. One of the back seats sits higher than the others, rattles a tiny bit
4. Driver's side door creaks a bit when the car goes over bumps
5. Only two or three minor alignment issues that I barely noticeI have a White Swiss Shepherd (80 lbs only, tiny compared to your Dane I'm sure), and we'll just be using Tesmanian weather mat for the cargo area for her, and I'll probably invest in a Variocage for longer trips that'll go on top of 2/3rds of the back seats folded down.

I'm hoping she can fit in the cargo area with the seats up, though the slopedI'm not sure if this will be helpful, but we started our pup on fluoxetine when we were in a phase where reactivity/fear was climbing at an alarming rate. Even if we didn't start her on fluoxetine at that time, I'm pretty sure her fear/anxiety would have shot up anyway.

What I'm saying is, could there be a chance it's not directly because of fluoxThat's so heartwarming to hear. You have really figured out how to make life pleasant for him! I love it when there's a working formula for things, like how to work on walks, how to introduce to a new person, etc. Yes, it's not convenient, but it works.

I think we're seeing a glimpse of the other side, I just don't want to jinx it. The fact that IShe could be overworked. Or maybe worked just url breeder breeds the line to be working dogs, and placed in homes as pets only if they’re active enough, but to be honest, I’m just going by assumptions. 

I think if we remove the fluoxetine factor, and she’s still as calm, then we can say she’s getting enough (or too much even) activity/stim. 

My oBut won’t Tesla fix these things? If you are compromising to a 3 simply because you don’t want to wait for them to right the wrong, then I get it, but seems strange to not give them a chance. 

I come from having a newer Audi S5, and yeah, those things are perfect out of the gate, so I definitely feel the pain, but seems like they’ll correct the isYup that makes sense! Definitely not trying to trivialize what you’re working on. I think you’re totally right in your approach. Just brainstorming just in case. 

With IFTTT, it’s easier if you can authenticate once with the service, then use one token. But it’s not very flexible if you ever needed another token or let others use it. 

I would jumI think IFTTT has some myQ interface. If you use anything like a webhook to trigger it (if this), then it should be fairly easy.

I think building out an IFTTT module that can interface with myQ will allow people to build anything on top of IFTTT, especially if it's just a webhook that anyone can call. Geofencing or just pressing a button that shooBlack/Black PUP ordered May 2019. I got a call a week before the SIP started in the SF Bay Area giving me an estimate for April delivery. But of course, everything got shut down.

I wasn't expecting the car until, at the earliest, Q4 2020 when I ordered it. With how the Model 3 went, I was even OK with it being pushed until 2021.

I even consideredWith a lot of velcro dogs (like GSDs), leaving the room as a time-out with a well timed: "Ow, too bad." will also go a long way.

We progressed from hard bites warranting us leaving the room, to even accidentally touching us with a tooth during play, leads to us leaving the room (closing the gate).

We only need to leave for 10 - 15 seconds and sheDang, so sorry to hear. Generally, I'm not very trusting of people who can hide behind the anonymity of the internet. I've yet to have a bad experience, everyone has been so awesome that I've met through the game, but I don't think I'll ever be surprised if I get a bad actor.

You might know already, but if you hit the \`-\` button, you can end theMine already expired, and still no sign of the car being produced yet, so I'm just going to wait and try again. My credit score took a small hit, but it's back up already. Even so, it wasn't enough of a dip to change much I'm guessing.

I feel bad saying we were getting ghosted, these people had to stop working for the same reasons a lot of others I got the email as well, black/black pup.

I had a call with a rep a week before SIP happened, and was told I'd be seeing my car in April. Of course that didn't happen, but just wanted to give you context on my order if that's helpful.

I had my insurance quote all ready, but now I believe it's no longer valid. I'm going to wait before putting thatFunniest thing happened:

Have you ever fallen into a hole?

Put down a chair. Dig a hole on one side. Go sit in it from the other. Then scoot off towards the hole. You fall right in. 

I was playing with my fiancé who is a secondary player. She went to sit on a garden chair as I was digging up a flower next to it. Then she tried to get off and bamI’ll try it. I want to pair it with someone who’s willing to then travel to Sunday and keep a constant flow of turnips coming from Daisy, and just split the winnings. 

So:
Island A — time travel to Wednesday for a good price 
Island B — time travel to Sunday to get turnips from daisy. Visits Island A with pockets of turnips to sell. Drops half offI would just point you to the right youtube videos, but it sounds like you've done that.

1. Checkered pattern will be the best (but even without that it'll work)
2. Water the flowers with a watering can
3. New ones will ONLY spawn from fully grown flowers. So don't pick the petals and stuff off, leave them, and don't expect buds etc. to spawn anytLet's say my nintendo switch breaks completely. What happens to my Island?

I have Nintendo Online membership, but I don't have a microsd (I can get one).

I just hope that after playing the game so much and building up my island, I would really hate to see it disappear because my switch breaks, gets stolen, I lose it, or what have you.

I read somCan I buy Cherry MX Silent Brown switches? I saw mention of them online, but I have never seen them for sale.

If not, are there other brands that are basically a silent version of browns?

My home office keyboard is loud, which is never a problem, but now that I'm on conference calls all the time, people can't hear anything while I type and take nI haven’t time traveled before, but could you theoretically jump ahead and back until you got a really good turnip buying price? 

I know your turnips would spoil, but you could then offer up your store to others?

My thought is:
1. Buy low and sell high somewhere
2. Time travel to Wednesday or Thursday of the week to try to get the highest buy priOK, I'm on day 8 or so of playing the game. I have two rooms in my house and full loan debt for that (like 300K bells or so). I already got three residences plots ready (one moved in today). The museum is there. Nook's Cranny is there. And mabel setup a stand in the little village area.

I'm not sure what to do next other than try to catch a stupidI’m making a ton of bells (relatively, I’m on day 5 of playing this game) by just going to a friend’s island and selling all my pairs from gathering them all during the day. What other good way is there to making bells?

I’m on day 5 playing. I have a slightly bigger roomed house, three new residence homes coming, and by the morning Blather museum At least in the U.S., it's such a delicate dance for asking people to "shelter-in-place." And then they say: "yeah sure, go outside for a walk, or hike, or visit all our parks, just stay 6 feet away from one another."

That first week, all the hiking trails and parks were flooded with people. So many parks had to close down because they were attracYou're right, it should be her pace. In the beginning it was, but now I expect too much from her.

Thank you for that. Along with more motivation etc, I think my mindset needs to be adjusted. I'll go on my own runs that I need without her for now. Maybe as a cool-down run, I'll come home, get her, and see if she'll jog around with me. Best case sceWe're taking advantage of the situation as well here. My pup is reactive to humans who stop and stare, especially if they reach. As long as they're moving, or start moving again, she's totally at ease with them, and will even boop them with a wagging tail to say hi (which gets her into trouble, because they stop... don't worry, I've learned to not I have a white dog as well, and she's 76lbs! Her current car that she makes me drive her around in, is a 2019 Subaru Outback. She hangs out comfortably in the cargo area. The hair is sort of a permanent part of the back cargo, but it doesn't travel into the rest of the car. And if it does, it doesn't stick to leather.

In the back, we have the weatIf you actually do a private sale, you can increase the resale value. I had a near perfect condition, 5 year old car, that I sold $10K over KBB because it was in such good condition. It's a black car, and because it was fully wrapped in XPEL since it only had 10 miles on the odometer, it was still perfect. Granted, the interior was also perfect, an1. You can repaint your car for about the same, but it's gonna be dinged up until you repaint it. So the wrap helps with that (like XPEL).
2. The ceramic coating seems like a huge gimmick, at least I have never seen it work well in practice. I would just skip that. If you already have XPEL wrap on it, why bother?
3. Don't wrap it for a different coSorry, I don't have your patience or humor. I would not have thought it was funny. I also don't have kids, just a dog, so maybe my perspective is wrong.

I would have just explained it, I don't think the kid means to be rude, I just don't think they understand. He might just think you're being irrationally mean.

I've had a very excited kid run up No problem, I love sharing and it's likewise great to hear what others are doing!

For reactivity triggers, I don't actually click. The "marker" for us is the trigger. So she sees a kid? That's a marker for a treat. Counter conditioning is basically that the thing she usually reacts to is actually a marker for a ton of hot dogs. I do celebrate a loTheoretically, businesses can still stay open without power/water?

I'm not disagreeing this isn't a good idea, I'm just wondering why fines aren't going to work or work in conjunction. I feel like every other enforcement in the world is a fine. Parking too long? Fine.

I think a lot should be done, but I'm surprised there's no ticketing/fining invMy pup is 76 lbs, I use the ruffwear flat out leash for running: [url](url)

It can also be worn around your wrist for more control.

Overall, I find that a big part of helping manage my pup's reactivity is helping maneuver her with the leash (like gently guiding her away, keeping her close enough so I can get a treat to her nose if we've accidentaI don't disagree, but aren't they staying open because they want continued revenue and are pretty much greedy? If you start fining them immediately, they will lose incentive to stay open and close. What if these businesses don't need water/power to technically stay open and are assholes to try to squeeze anything out. Like run a power generator, juSo are you saying that they will continue to stay open because they have a chance to avoid a fine? I guess this is a good argument, but let's assume every non-essential business is fined that stays open. Isn't that going to work? I can't imagine why it's not painful to get fined. I agree it's painful to lose power/water, but you lose all incentive Same argument can be made for shutting off water/power. I might have to respond to everyone about this, but isn't one of the reasons assholes are staying open when they're not essential, is because they want revenue? If there are fines, that just defeats the purpose.

What if these places still run without water? That's even worse. If they're ignorCoincidentally, chrome deleted cars are the only ones I've bought.

I bought my 2014 Audi S5 because there was a "titanium" or black edition, where there is no chrome by default, and the wheels are dark grey. It's beautiful.

Now the Model Y, that comes without chrome!

It's weird to call it "chrome delete," since it never had chrome that was removThere is a lot of back peddling sometimes. A few tips:

1. After a setback, give her 3 days to reset. If you don't give her a fair chance to clear her cortisol and start again, she's never going to progress. One setback with a nice buffer of time to reset is almost nothing. But one setback after another, where her stress bucket is never clear, is gPuppies can develop reactivity out of nowhere, not always because of a direct incident. And maybe it was, but nobody noticed (not even the puppy maybe).

I think it's hard to describe exactly how we handled the reactivity, and I think if you're looking for one easy trick, it doesn't exist. This was why our journey was so incredibly hard, it was almYour situation is probably slightly different than our initial fear. Initial fear was better after she realized our home was her home and a safe place. She started bonding hard with me and my fiance. I work from home and she literally never left my side for at least a month (that was tough for me), and the only isolation was in a crate which was alI used to want people to see how amazingly sweet and loving my pup was, but then I gave up that dream. It wasn't because it's not what I want, it just seemed like I was constantly failing if that was the goal. What I wanted was to be succeeding even from the start. What does that mean? Yes, setbacks happen, but when your goal is for your dog to lovYeah, I have always had black cars (5 of them in the past), and currently own a black one. I know what you mean though, but it's worth it for me.

I have a garage, my cars are usually fully wrapped in XPEL ultimate so I can just take a car duster brush to it every day, and I don't mind giving it a wash every week or two (or I've gotten used to it).I currently use the Travall guard for my Subaru Outback, mostly to keep the pup from constantly licking the back seat passengers for long trips, and also from flying through the front windshield in an accident (I know it's not enough for all situations, but it's something).

I'm hoping they'll make one specifically for the MY at some point. What otYeah, it sounds like you need the backseat folded for the noodlehorse, but he does seem like a long noodle =)

I almost never have 4 people in the car, with the backseat reserved for dog hair and a rolled up windshield sun screen, so I think I could probably spare at least one of the seats. But perhaps she'll be just fine for most trips. If we go oTemperature. If it gets too cold, the All Seasons turn into ice skates. 

You will benefit a lot even if it doesn’t get *that* cold. It’s really apparent when you get on some winter tires, even if your A/S did “fine”. 

I used to visit a lot of the National Parks in the winter, and many times chain control required actual winter tires on even AWD cWork hard!! As damn hard as you can!! It’s for the pup as much as it is for you. Your pup will be so much better after learning all of it. 

I posted that 130 days ago. Can you believe it, but I can do so many things now with my pup. We spent weeks with my niece and nephews playing with her. She goes up to strangers to nicely say hi (not always, bu
