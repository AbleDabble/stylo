A crate just big enough to turn around in is good for potty training. But once that's over (which is pretty quick), if you still want to crate, you should just get the biggest one you can fit in the house.

Get a smaller one, but be ready to get bigger if you ever need. It's just part of having a pup. You can't always get one size and be sure it'll be the right one.That's interesting. We already have had home assessments for our refinance, we have had agents in the past pull comparable homes in the area, so we know what we can maybe get and what we can afford based on debt/income ratios and all that.

So we have all of that, but I think what you're saying is, one agent can actually coordinate it all for us, both the buy and sell. Obviously they would get some kind of service fee (something like 6% of what we take from the sale I'm reading?), but that's probably better than handling all of it and renting a place.This seems nice, though I'm not entirely sure it's feasible because of the following (let me know if I'm off):

1. I might need to do some repairs to the house before selling (which means I'll probably need to move out in between)
2. The market is pretty crazy right now, I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be able to buy a home if it had a contingency vs. everyone else who are ready to buy immediately (houses are sold within minutes of being listed sometimes).When you say as soon as the other dog is in "sight," it's too much? Like how far away?

In many cases, you're just too close. In a rare case, a mile away is still too close. The threshold is usually the distance from the trigger (in addition to other things, like the type of dog, how many dogs, how many dogs you saw recently, etc).

If your pup is out of control over their threshold, you won't be able to effectively work on something like counter-conditioning. Best to reset, move back, etc.

I think a tip I would have is to try to understand the threshold and set up intentional training sessions with someone who will bring a dog and have them situated far away. The hope is that with careful setups, you'll start to learn what is actually a good distance where your pup sees the trigger as the mark and will take the reward happily. Then just keep working on conditioning there, advancing as you can in terms of distance. I really like the whole BAT 2.0 from Grisha Stewart, which really drives that idea home.

On another note, my pup had a very unpredictable threshold. Sometimes she would think that any noise would be from her trigger. That a strange shape in the distance is a threatening kid. We could never get her cortisol levels down enough, and had a very hard time getting her to any productive working threshold. Working with a behaviorist and a veterinarian, we went the route of adding in medication (fluoxetine in our case) to help as a training tool. It helped her in her reset days to fully recover, and it helped us maintain a more predictable and consistent threshold. After a year, we were able to start weaning her off of it, as she was starting to be able to process her emotions rather than quickly reacting. Of course, all dogs are different and you'll definitely want to talk to your veterinarian/behaviorist about it all to make sure it's actually the case that you should do it.A lot of people whistle randomly for their dogs, that's one reason why an emergency word might be better, especially if it's really weird.

My friends do regular low-priority recall by whistling, and some people I know just whistle constantly to try to get their dogs to recall (and it doesn't work, so they just keep doing it). These common sounds just aren't great, in my opinion, for an emergency.

So maybe it needs to be a pretty unique whistle?

Anyway, saying "LEGS" is pretty unique already, I bet that'll work for almost all things.

In addition to that, we also have worked on impulse control forever as well. Yelling "wait" from anywhere will stop her from moving forward. One combination we have in our toolbet is a wait and then "touch" or the emergency word.Glad it worked out! We never used the AbsoluteDog challenge, but we've trained a lot in terms of recall. One of the biggest one is an emergency recall word. We use "NOW," and we only ever use it in public during an emergency.

The way we train it is first by just shoving bits sardines from a can (in spring water) everytime we say the word "NOW". We've done this for a year now, about two or three times a month (sometimes more). We sometimes incorporate it into recall training as well, where we're a bit further and say the word in more real-world settings instead of just in the kitchen.

But it's always followed up with sardines, butt scratches, tons of excitement.

I've used it twice in her 2 years, and it's worked.

I would highly recommend working on anything like "LEGS" or any emergency word on a regular basis, forever. This is something we will never stop reinforcing.u/LilacPenny I know you're angry, as you have every right to be, but this comment by u/Impressive-Elk2192 is what you need to work on.

You are the only one that can advocate properly for your dog, and to be honest, we cannot change and educate every single person we find. There are much bigger battles to fight.

When I worked with my behaviorist, one of the things we worked on the most was me advocating for my dog's space. I would rehearse different lines over and over again, until it was automatic and completely emotionless (like I wasn't even thinking, I would just say it). I have lines for adults, kids, adults with kids, homeless people, drunk people, adults with dogs, kids with dogs, adults with kids and dogs, and so on. Along with my diverse artillery of "give us space," I also have a lot of ways to get away from the people. I'll always try to turn or cross the street to avoid as the first step (yeah, it gets annoying, but that's life, walking is not going in a straight line down a sidewalk anymore). The other thing is, I'll use body language, body blocking, and other things to manage the pup to a safer place. Lastly, I have a harness on her that looks like a "working dog" harness that has red ID patches that says "GIVE SPACE" - another warning but not enough by itself.

At the end of every encounter, I make it a point to thank the stranger(s) for helping. They may not always deserve the thanks, but it smooths out the encounters for me emotionally. A lot of times, kids will ask to pet and I will say: "no, I'm sorry, she is too shy and fearful" then, "thank you so much for asking, you did the right thing" To kids, the word "shy" is relatable, and the word "fearful" is known and powerful... most of the times.

I also make a point to thank any adults with kids there, especially if their kids did really well. If their kids did not, I try to see if I can quickly tell them: "not all dogs love kids, and some can be aggressive. Mine is not, but it's good practice to teach your kids to ask and not approach first to keep them safe."

Anyway, it's not easy, and you're justified in your thoughts, but hopefully you can work on putting all your tools together to advocate for your dog.My previous cars I've kept for 8+ years. They were sold in near mint condition each time, and for much more than KBB (my last car was $22K on KBB, but I sold it for $36K easily). I may have been lucky, but one of the reasons I was able to resell them for so much was because I took care of them as if I was going to own the car forever. Getting the best PPF protection, any accessories/aftermarket items were the best possible, and taking a lot of care of it. At the end of the day, going the extra mile, actually paid off in a way.

The Model Y, maybe I'll do the same, but if there's a refresh Model X that's coming, I might drop the Y and get the X instead. It's a lot more expensive, but if it's something I can stick with forever, I might just make the switch.

I like the extra space the X has, and with a big dog, it would be worth the investment. But that's all if the model X will have a refresh. Maybe in a couple of years?

Other option, if I can afford it, would be to just keep the MY and get a MX, but that might not be practical.Going with a well-researched breeder gets your chances up for what you're hoping for. Health, behavior, energy, natural working tendencies, and all that.

Adopt don't shop is a great message, as long as it means not going to a pet store puppy/mill source. What we're trying to avoid is bad breeders. Adopting is great, because it gives a dog a second chance. But those aren't the only options.

Like others have said, I won the genetic lottery and somehow got a reactive dog from a breeder with almost zero signs of reactivity. I was also reassured by trainers/behaviorists that we didn't do anything obviously wrong, so it is most likely purely just bad luck.

I still am all for doing the right research and going with a breeder that is thoroughly vetted. That sets you up if you'd like.I'm going to get a set of AllSeasons for my 21" at some point, and carry chains just in case during spring/fall. On long roadtrips where I live, you can get pretty high into the sierras and you'll get some cold temps (0 F) possibly in spring or fall, but only for a small section (a couple of hours at most).

In those cases, All Seasons might not be good enough and will turn into ice skates. Having the chains for safety is a good idea.Our walks as a puppy were always 100% training. It was exhausting. My pup, like anyone's, is always going for the suicidal acts haha.

As time went on, I realized the same thing. Our morning walks I bring a mug of coffee to enjoy, and we stop at a few places to just sit and watch (a good training/socialization thing to do too). My puppy was very fear reactive and default suspicious, so sitting with plenty of distance from things and enjoying the view, while shoving hot dog bits into her, were very pleasant.1. Start teaching impulse control immediately, and practice multiple times a day. This can be done with simply waiting to go out an open door, waiting for food, etc. Advance towards rewarding calm. Impulse control will translate to so much and is incorporated into all sorts of training. Note: this is not great for some working dogs because it CAN dampen prey drive/independence etc. which is required for things like SAR.
2. Focus on off-leash skills (recall at different levels, suggestion that needs to be adhered to soon, an immediate recall, and an emergency recall that has to work every time).
3. Focus on on-leash skills (impulse control is huge here, but do this early and daily). I worked on this twice a day with my dog, every day, for 2 years. She's not perfect even with all of that, but our walks are amazing.
4. Paws ALWAYS on the ground. We never taught her things like "shake" and we never let her jump on anything until she was about 18 months old (both for growth plate sake and also so she didn't get in a habit of jumping on anything). We did a ton of no jumping on people while she was a mere 20 lbs, and by the time she was 25 lbs she was completely a non-jumping dog. Now at 85 lbs, she would utterly destroy people if she was jumping, even once.

She's kind of old now, but puppy tax can be found scrolling back: urlI literally never took my eyes off my pup until she was in a crate. You're being responsible, you're learning about her, and overall you're keeping her safe.

My puppy was a tornado. She would come out of her create and leave a path of death and destruction behind. I was constantly redirecting her. I watched her like a hawk, hovering around, making everything a training moment.

It was exhausting.

How did I take a break? I didn't hand her off. I set her up to be exhausted herself.

I would dedicate an hour to just play and train with her, nose work, and all sorts of fun things. Towards the end of the hour, I would play crate games with her, and ultimately I would throw in a big chewy snack and close the door. The crate would be next to a makeshift bed I made for myself. Then I would just take  2 hour nap, and my exhausted puppy would take a 2 hour nap.

Sometimes in those 2 hours, I would do things like, brush my teeth, make breakfast, work, take a breather. My entire day was chunked up in 2 hour sections. It sucked, but I got into a rhythm. I knew it wouldn't be forever.

My puppy was destructive for so many months, but one day she just stopped. My redirecting "leave it" commands were rock solid, I always had an artillery of treats/toys to redirect and trade with, my home office was barren of anything other than my bitter sprayed desk and chair.

I made it. Find your rhythm.I also want to reiterate that puppies are highly distracted. Don't get down on the fact that he's not always 100% ready to work. In fact, if you KNOW a command isn't going to work through experience and reading his body language, then don't train the command. It loses it's power every time it doesn't work.

So sometimes, just shrug it off. Either you're not in the right state of mind to be exciting enough, or he's simply a puppy and needs a different environment to train in. If you're up for it, set him up for success, then start training. Otherwise, just relax, let him be for awhile.Your GSD is way smarter than you give him credit for. It's you to blame. It's not that he isn't listening. It's not that he doesn't remember. You have to set him up for success.

I taught my pup how to crawl one day, took a few tries. But other than that one day, we never practiced it. A few months later, my pup was super engaged with me. She was hungry (we feed her through training), I was in a super excited mood and she was super excited to play with me. She didn't care about anything else, wasn't distracted, and was hyper focused. Why? Because I was more interesting than anything else at that moment. I had the food. I had the energy. She was so excited to work.

And then, I just decided to work on her crawling again. I asked her to crawl, and bam, she did it. Months later. at 9 months old. No practice.

She's not a prodigy. It was just the perfect storm.

What you need to work on is, engaging with your pup and getting them focused. I wouldn't force them to be focused on a boring and kind of grumpy person. Instead I would make myself way more exciting. Him not listening is probably a product of him just not hearing you because he's so focused on something else. If you were more exciting that something else, then he would absolutely listen, and you know as well as anybody, he knows the commands.

Now, puppies are INCREDIBLY distracted all the time. So it's not 100% your fault. That's just how it is. Set yourself up for success first, before expecting anything.

1. Get to an environment where he will have less distractions (you advance this as you go, like my dog can do distance commands in the middle of 10 of her favorite dog friends, but you start with the easiest thing, indoors probably in a boring place).
2. If he's food/toy driven, find the time when he's most likely to be hungry or ready to play
3. Make sure you're in a very happy mood. Think to yourself: "does my dog want to play with me? or is just tolerating me?"
4. Ramp up. Just throw treats or the toy a few times without requiring any work. Then start with some easy things once you know they're focused on the toy/food.
5. You'll feel it, you'll feel the engagement. It's different for a lot of dogs, and it's not easy. We took a month long class on engagement, and we still have a lot to learn. 
6. A lot of training is learning how to best communicate with your dog. That means engagement. Ultimately your pup will be so used to engaging with you, and you'll know so much about how to get to there, that you'll get instant response to your commands in all sorts of situations. Overall, be aware of yourself. It's you, not them.Comparison is always a factor, but you'll learn that it's unfair to your pup.

This is a whole other topic, but our puppy became very fear reactive. You think puppy blues is bad? Imagine fear turning into seemingly lifelong reactivity that keeps you from doing anything you love and having a dog that is fearful of everything. THAT is 1,000x harder than anything. When that hit, it was impossible to compare our pup with what everyone else was going through. All dogs have their own paths, good or bad, it's up to us, the humans, to help them. There's nobody else that can.

The good end to this story is, we now have the most balanced pup ever. We are so in tune with her, and we wouldn't be anywhere close to having such a bond without having gone through so much.Frisbee is tough. First, you don't want your puppy jumping a lot when they're young (growth plates and all that).

How we started was doing "rollers," where you spin the frisbee on it's side so it rolls away. If your pup has the right drive, he/she will run after it and try to grab it, just like anything else that's running away (prey drive).

The idea is that your pup will grab the frisbee as it's rolling away. Once your pup is cleared for jumping activities (I'd wait until about 1.5 to 2 years as a general rule, but check with your vet to be extra sure. Our dog is on the large size at 80 lbs, so we waited until 18 months), then you can doing tosses in the air for them to grab.

I suck at throwing a frisbee, so it takes some time to get used to it.

We really like the Chuck-it Parasail frisbee the most. It's soft, durable, and is fairly easy to throw once you've learned its balance.

We've also taught our pup to "swing" around to gain a ton of speed before we throw. To train this, we just lure her around our body (clockwise if we're right handed and throwing from the left side of our body) and give her the release word immediately ("OK GO GET IT"). This gets her to build speed so that when we release the frisbee she is already accelerating forward to catch it, otherwise, your dog might not have enough speed to get to the frisbee by the time it hits the ground.
