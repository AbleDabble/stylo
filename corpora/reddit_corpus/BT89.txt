Yes, although the format is usually substantially different in the International ones - one of the main things is that it you can bring players on from your subs bench/change your captain as you move through a round of matches in the groups, quarters and semis, etc

&#x200B;

E.g Kane plays on match day 1 of the first round of fixtures in the groups, if he blanks or scores poorly, you can select someone playing on Match Day 2, surrender Kane's double points in the hope your next captain scores more.

Don't know if they will do it again this year, but it takes a little getting used to.Same - Every single person i play in rookie 3 throughout the 9 holes in qualifying has maxed out clubs, so I'm assuming that's the same in my tournament round too, and I have mid to low level clubs at best.

&#x200B;

It's not a level playing field - there's a couple of holes in this tourney where you can not reach the par 5s in 2 shots without better clubs.

How is that fair that I'm in the same bracket as these people?Please watch - url

I am 100% correct. Using the phrase "I could care less" when you're trying to convey that something doesn't bother you, makes absolutely zero sense - so you're trying to say that you don't care much, but there's room for caring less? No, that's not what you're trying to say. 
The phrase is "I couldn't care less", in that you are at the absolute maximum of not caring. 

I don't even know why I'm trying to explain it, the video is perfectly capable of blowing any argument you have out of the water! Enjoy!It's not even a slight improvement, honestly, the beginner bot has become impossible for a beginner like me to beat now. I'll finish this game and see if i can post the game to you.

Edit:  OK can't find out how to post my game to you, but the Bot played with 91.3% accuracy apparently. This is the lowest possible rated bot!

Edit: for reference, just played the 250 bot on browser and beat him only half-paying attention in about 4 minutes.TBF though (although I massively wanted to diss this post for having a clickbait title), it's a good point that people are saying the announcement has surely got to be today, and if the Prem tend to announce fixtures at 4pm, then it's a good shout that's when it'll happen.

Rather than making it sound like Ben Crellin has said it could come in an hour, should have said "Ben C says biggest double gameweek - fixtures tend to be announced at 4PM so a good chance we might see something in the next hour"Yes, which is what I'm saying - Football players seem to have a completely separate set of rules already when applied to sporting activities (for example, they can travel to red-listed countries in the first place) - football based activates appear to operate outside of the General population rules, but then Sergio Aguero still has to wear his facemask in the local Tesco.IT just seems like a half way house - if they're allowed to travel to the red-listed countries in the first place, why then does the 10 day quarantine come in to place with with domestic football - surely they either follow the rules and don't go at all, or sports related activates are exempt and the quarantine doesn't apply - seems a tad ridiculousA bit of a juxtaposed statement though, if public health trumps professional sports, then you could argue none should be going ahead right now? (also, that's what I'm saying is ridiculous - if they're allowed to travel to the red-listed countries in the first place, why then does the 10 day quarantine come in to place with with domestic football - surely they either follow the rules and don't go at all, or sports related activates are exempt and the quarantine doesn't apply - seems a tad ridiculous)I would have thought they're still allowed to play and train, and that the quarantine probably just applies to everything else in their life?  Ridiculous if that's not the case.

Edit: to clarify the ridiculousness is mainly aimed at the fact that Football players seem to have a completely separate set of rules when it comes to football (can travel to red-listed countries, can be in groups of larger than x amount, etc), so, I would have though that domestic footy was exempt from a 10 day quarantine too - but applying it to their personal life would ensure they aren't spreading any new strains into their local area, as intended.Rather than reply to each comment, I'd just like to put out a blanket statement that I disagree that it should ever be a "risky shot" to get the ball onto the green. 

I fully understand that there are parts of a green where the hole cannot be reached, but my point is that these shouldn't exist in the first place, and if they do you should have the option to chip in - Hazards in golf are bunkers, water traps, physical barriers (trees, lamp-posts) and rough, not the green!As said below, if this type of thing was allowed the entire sub would just be posts about everyone's individual team (look at the amount of questions in the RMT thread) - any useful stuff would just get lost in the mire. 

I'd say you were asking for advice on who to [bench/how](url) to use your bench more efficiently, which should be in the RMT Thread.Problem with having a super-good bench. I can't be arsed with the consistent decision making required and disappointment of constantly getting it wrong.

4.0 Def (playing or not, don't care)  
4.5 Def (playing defender, only decision i have to make is rotate with my other 4.5 defender)  
4.5 playing mid (only there as back up, someone like bissouma)Stupid post. Everyone's saying stuff like "4 million GW3, etc" but overall rank is so volatile in the first few weeks it means nothing - I'm the first 3 weeks the space between top 10k and 4 million is probably a few points. 

Its more interesting to ask later in the season where people have gone from here, say 2 million rank in gw20 to top 10k final position, that's impressive/interesting.Lol, clinging at straws aren't we. I suggested that because I couldn't fathom what the hell you were on about. 

What points that then?  That I didn't read your article? It's completely irrelevant if I read the rest of the article in detail or not - I'm focussing on one point, and one point alone, the Vardy suggestion at the end. Doesn't matter if you picked him based off stats, or picked him from a stat-less perspective. It does not affect or deflect from my point - **Vardy is injured**. 

The rest of the article is irrelevant to this conversation -- my point is that he's not going to play in the next couple of games, so it's absurd to suggest him as one of "the best forwards to own **right now**". End off. No need to say anything more. 

If your aim is to provide help to FPL players, then hey, I'm your target market, and I'm giving you this feedback to take forward and improve what you are providing to your target audience (hi, me again) - don't suggest an injured player who it has been stated will be out for a few weeks as a pick for "right now" - a couple of people have picked up on it in the comments, and you want to come across as knowledgeable and trustworthy, so don't.He's clearly not going to play though.  He's just had hernia surgery and it's been stated multiple times he'll be out for a few weeks...

But hey ho, we might as well disregard all common sense and facts and suggest Pele will come out of retirement and sign for Burnley at 80y.o, but will start playing like he's 20 again, so he is the top pick, SHOULD it happen of course.Sorry mate, it feels a bit like I'm talking to a brick wall here - how are you not understanding this?  Your page is called "Statistically - the best forwards to own right now in FPL" - and your advice is to own, "**Right now**", a player who won't play in the next match, and likely not in the one after too? Even when he's back, you're going to have 2 more weeks of data from every other player, as well as fixture changes (Leicester's fixtures change for the worst in my opinion after the next 2) - it is utterly useless suggesting him as a top pick now, as there is so much that can change in 2 weeks.

Regardless of all that I've said above - Vardy is injured, nobody in their right mind has ever suggested bringing in a player that has just had groin surgery and is flagged to be out for at least 2 weeks as their top pick "right now".

Picking Vardy is not "Unrelated to stats", more "unrelated to common sense"Mate, James scoring one goal in the last game doesn't mean he's "hitting form", surely he needs consistent goals/assists with stats to back up the numbers before you can say a player is "hitting form"

I mean, I'd avoid any attacking aspect of Everton till those numbers improve.Pick you bread and butter Premiums - tried and tested and you know they consistently score points (Salah, Son, etc) try and find those 4.0/4.5 value defenders, a good 4.5 keeper and a couple of bench guys.  The rest is spreading the remaining budget on players and stretching it as far as you can - Justin this season filling in for the injured Pereira, etc.  Stick to price points for each position to remain flexible if needed.I pussied out of swapping him for KDB this week due to the sheer number of people captaining him and saying how he was going to boss it this GW - instead i took out Son which, to this point, looks like i picked the wrong premium - If he hauls against Burnley then I suppose it's the right decision, but wish I'd stuck to my guns on this one and just done it.Personally I think holding on to a player just for value hurts your points - I've experimented this season playing the "Hokey-Kokey" with my premiums and I'm fairing much better than I have in previous seasons (I used FPL General's idea of a Captain Matrix, making sure I had that player who was the best captaincy choice for that week, even if it meant taking out someone like Salah).

I'm sure Salah will bounce back at some point, but why not capitalise on his quiet spell while everyone else holds on to him by bringing in someone who is playing well, has good fixtures and you think might fair better over the coming weeks?It isn't chasing points, I'm talking about his form improving, not his points - For as long as I can remember, Salah has topped (if not, then always in the top 3) all the attacking metrics you'd look at when choosing a Premium Attacker - Shots in the Box, Touches in the Box, Big Chances, xG, etc.  For most of those he's not even in the Top 10, let alone top 20 for some of them - and surprise surprise, he has blanked in his last four games.

So I'd make a case that he's not taking those opportunities to shoot as much as he used to for god knows what reason, thus he is out of form (or something has changed at Liverpool as a team and that's affecting him) and justifiably could be removed from your team if you aren't happy spending that much on someone who's stats aren't justifying his price. Once I see Salah back up there in all those metrics I like to see, I know points are coming, so there's the case to bring him back in.Wow, there's overthinking things, and then there's this.

Yes, your player could get rested for perhaps one of these games - but would you rather take a nailed starter with a shit run instead of somebody that could get rested for one game but is pretty much guarenteed a clean sheet when they start?

Seems like 3 x 2 points against 2 x 6 points to me.Am I mad for thinking of removing Salah for KDB?

Liverpool haven't looked great of late, and Salah's attacking stats have fallen off a cliff - then again, although KDBs are better in each individual metric, Man City haven't scored the most goals recently.

KDB's DGW, and fixtures for the next few, seem better than Liverpool's - I'm hearing a lot of people considering Salah as a good captain choice this weekend which is making me doubt myself.Obvious concern for players health and safety aside, I'm finding this season so interesting from an FPL perspective - never has it been so spontaneous, you can go from one piece of devastating news one day, to a complete turnaround the next - it's astounding.

I would of course rather not be going through this shit time with everyone else, but it sure is making things captivating.If they only played twice, that would suggest that them appearing in the "lower stats conceded" lists is because they've only played 180 minutes of football as opposed to 270 like some, or 360 like most of the other teams - so they would be more likely to have conceded less shots/goals than other teams - ergo don't trust them appearing in these lists on face value.

Saying that, in there last few ***MATCHES*** (not GW), they are putting up some impressive defensive stats.One caveat I might add is that in a normal free hit week, the cheapest playing bench is always the aim (this year not so much due to postponements and players having to isolate - also playing in a single gameweek is risky as you haven't got that second game cushion of a double), being able to pick a 3.9 and 3.8 defender compared to the midfield cheapies of 4.5 or 4.4 is saving almost 0.5 per non-playing player, which could become valuable when invested in someone who actually plays - As a result of this, I don't think 5 at the back is valid personally as you're wasting around a million on your bench - I'd perhaps go 4 maximum.The one earlier this year was completely out of the blue, with no system set up to test players/no protocols if anybody did catch it etc. 

I would suggest that as the Prem didn't stop during late 2020's lockdown, it will continue this time regardless of National Rules - there is a small chance there could be an internal Premier League "circuit breaker", but personally i think that is unlikely.

In future I would suggest holding onto chips and transfers till as late as possible, when you know as much information as possible, just in case something happens.If you feel a highly owned player is about to hit a bad spell, you can bring in a lower owned player (perhaps 1-5% owned) in the hope that the highly owned player will blank, and you're player will haul - thus you are part of the few that take the points where as everyone else misses out - for example Son this weekend blanked, but if you bought in Sterling instead, you will benefit over 62% of the game.

&#x200B;

Differentials do work, you just need the highly owned player to blank, and your player to bang.I do yes. I commute via country roads every day to work.

Ah, not aimed at me unfortunately, I see it said to others all over reddit (like when somebody has ran out of logical responses). As this one's aimed at me, might be worth mentioning I actually actively avoid parties - much prefer a night on the sofa watching a film with the wife, the dog and a bottle of wine! Call me an introvert if you must!Too true.

Anyway, all these comments arguing the fact bought about a little google search into the highway code - 

 

### Rule 114

You **MUST NOT**

* use any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders

&#x200B;

Would you believe it, it's actually law to dip your beams!  So as far as I'm concerned, the "well i'm driving a tonne of metal so i need to see" excuses don't stack up, if that was the case, I'm sure the law would agree!How does "Full Beams" imply that? My village has no street lighting, yet the speed limit is 30 through it - there are repeater signs enforcing this, and pavements along both sides of the road. Along with a headtorch, I also have a dog with a superbright flashing LED collar - as I've also stated in a previous comment, I can see pedestrians walking down the road with no reflective clothing, and no lighting a good 100m off - I think it's more so the nonces don't have the courtesy to dip the beams when they can full well see someone walking towards them.

&#x200B;

> the person driving a 1300kg machine at a deadly speed needs to be able to see better than a pedestrian 

I would say that dipped headlights are sufficient enough to see said person - and I mean if we want to get technical, lets look at the highway code -  

### Rule 114

You **MUST NOT**

* use any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to other road users, **including pedestrians**, cyclists and horse riders.

So, yeah, I'd say I'm within my rights to expect cars to dip their beams when passing me - I'd say if they can't see me (with full beams from about 5m away), then should they be driving that 1300kg machine in the first place?I have KDB, Son, Bruno, and enough in the bank to upgrade one of them to Salah for the fixture against Fulham.

Long term, I would like KDB, Salah, Bruno - but for this week, do I move Son to Salah when Son has a potentially good fixture vs Palace and KDB and Bruno have a potentially tough fixture against eachother - OR - do i move one of  KDB or Bruno out for Salah for a one week move, if so, Which?No sorry, should have explained I have 2 FT available - and reading my initial comment back, it's very confusing.

So, I want KDB for GW11, and Salah for GW12  
Possible transfers out are Rodriguez, Son or Kane (for whatever various reasons)

A couple of scenarios I have - 

1) GW11 Rodriguez to KDB and Kane to 6mil fwd then GW12 Son to Salah

2) GW11 Rodriguez to KDB and Son to Jota then GW12 KDB to Salah (Man City play Man U in that week so it's not a great fixture to hold both Bruno and KDB)
