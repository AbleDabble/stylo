I'd say technically you're not doing worse - your points scores are all around a similar mark, it's probably the total number of players increasing each yer that's making your rank seem worse.

I had a decent first season back in 2016 due to being a LCFC supporter and with some bias having pre-loaded my team with their assets. I haven't got anywherInteresting diagram - not sure it's really apt for the sub though - cutting it in half only serves to show the inside of the sand banks, which, believe it or not, look like sand.

How can you have a " rotational equivalent to mass", isn't one a force/movement and one a property of an object?

EDIT: No, apparently you can - "Moment of inertia" is the rotational equivalent to say the mass of an object when working out the force needed to move it in a certain direction - you needI wouldn't worry about "which clubs in particular", or course some clubs are better than others, but if I've learnt anything from having an alt account and having to play with a low variety of clubs, you can master any of them if you use their strongest qualities - All you need to do is 

1) learn to visualise where the ball will go with clubs withTrue, you've got a point.  Just frustrates me.

Guess the sub could do with some rules on at least checking before posting (this specific one is literally 2 posts below already)/more active moderation (most of the stuff posted on here isn't ironic at all). From the downvotes I've received, seems like people don't care about seeing the same shit on I was going to post asking the same thing earlier - wanted to see what people thought - last season we had around 6 weeks to set up a squad - with this seasons start being 12th Sept, that would make August 1st 6 weeks - meaning next seasons game could launch next week (?!)

Do I think that'll be the case? I doubt it - I'm sure they're already gettiPerhaps you should google this yourself - the game launched over a month before the first kick-off this season giving a full 5 weeks to tinker.

It's actually a pretty valid question with such a short break before next season (early September start), going off the normal amount of time from launch to GW1, next seasons game would launch in a couple Seeing is believing, and I didn't see 50 people's chip-in replays - just a score card saying they did.  Without seeing every single one of those shots, I'm finding it hard to believe the majority managed to get at least one chip in.

OPs "mate" has clearly just misunderstood the picture - just because the titles are above certain pictures, doesn't mean they apply/are relevant to each specific picture.  Just sloppy editing by whoever made it.

In fact I would suggest the picture is pro PlayStation - it's not irony just because your friend has mIt's not irony. It's just incorrect/a mistake

My partner has also told me that the vast majority (if not all) of her colleagues also appreciate all the support and gratitude they are receiving - a lot of them have said they take being called a "hero" as a onPatronising response - ok I'll bite. My partner is a nurse, in the UK people stand outside their houses and applaud our health service at 8pm every Thursday. 
She appreciates this and finds it motivating, it helps her continue. 

You don't speak for everyone when you say the gratitude is not welcome, think about the people that find it useful and hSorry to hear about your situation, but you've got it utterly and completely 100% wrong. If anybody is shooting anybody, it's yourself, and in your own foot...

Healthy people should be doing their shopping in store, and leaving the delivery/click and collect slots for the vulnerable. Tesco have actively encouraged people to do more in store shoppi"we're going to carry on as normal and build a herd immunity" - "that's outrageous!! How inhumane think of all the people that will die!"

"Ok, we're going to shut all non-essential services/businesses down as we lockdown and protect everyone" -"that's outrageous, think of all the people that will lose their jobs!"

I mean, I don't understand what Wouldn't even bother trying to get through to people on here - I've had so much backchat from people moaning that they still have to go into work and can't sit on there arse all day and get paid for free.  People think it's some sort of big holiday!  Personally have to see my partner come home every single day (nurse) exhausted from this, so forgivWas going to say, for the absolute nightmare this has all been, I think he's handled it really well (or as well as you can handle this) - like to see this guy try to manage an entire country through a pandemic, taking into consideration everything from people's health to the economy at the back end of this - Boris isn't the one who sounds like the So are illegal immigrants from the UK already then? You are showing prejudice against people from another country getting tested for Covid-19 and saying this is a waste of kits - that's racist - the sub has removed your post because it's racist and you've also been constantly and consistently downvoted in your comments afterwards because it is, ind&gt;Fwiw, on that basis I actually don't get the once a day thing

I think it's a blanket statement just to cover everybody - they can't be dithering about saying if you live in a small village you can go out twice, cities once, etc. Stick to the advice as much as you can, but take it with a pinch of salt based on your situation. Take your dog out Got called a "fucking retard" on here yesterday by some 75 year old cockwomble for asking if it was acceptable to take my dog out 3 times for short walks, rather than one big walk - spreading the walks over the day alleviates boredom and pent up energy he has - one big walk would be forgotten about 3 hours later and then I'd have a mental dog for 2Then that is fair enough - sorry for my initial attitude, I should have read the petition description more carefully.

 I've just seen a lot of people treating it like it's a big holiday and everyone gets 3 months of paid leave from work, and people moaning because they still actually have to work for their money. It's really grinding my gears now.I think Halfords could be classed as essential, NHS workers still need to drive to and from work, along with many other essential services that need cars in working order. 

Read a few posts on here basically moaning that people still have to go to work - it feels a bit like people just want to be signed off work and get paid for sitting on their aI'm still doing 3 (Spaniel Collie cross so has to be kept as tired as possible or is an absolute nightmare), on my own, not speaking to anyone and crossing the road/avoiding anybody I see.

Precautions are being taken to protect the vulnerable, the healthy should be fine, let's not bring Exactly what I was thinking - measures are being taken to protect the elderly and those with underlying health conditions - I think the idea is that those who will largely remain unaffected by the virus should try to carry on as usual as best they can.

It's a really British way of doing things - if it works we should come out the other side with v&gt; Dude, the FA and governing bodies decide what happens to the PL they don’t decide what price changes get made or the rules to FPL... do you really think the prem codes the FPL website? It’s outsourced. Do you really think in the emergency meeting after Arteta got confirmed positive they all sat down and discussed what to donfantasy football? 
But they are directly linked to the PL, you're acting as if they are to completely separate things, and one doesn't influence the other. When it says "fantasy" it's not a completely fabricated points system you know?  When someone scores in the actual PL, the fantasy player gets those points you know?  - so why would they not suspend all FPL transfYou're overly simplifying that one - they're using the social media platform they find so useless to make sure their message is spread to as many people as possible - in essence meaning that Facebook is not useless at all - this is probably one of the most complicated ones on there - almost paradoxical actually - they're telling people something isIt's just not ironic to say you'll delete something within a certain time, and then don't/forget or whatever the reason - that's just someone lying or being forgetful. That's not what Irony is.

Aiming not to FH GW31 and get in as many playing players as possible.

Before last night the plan was Vardy and Traore out, Jimenez and Sarr (or similar) in.

Vardy has well and truly messed up those plans now as I would like to hold for another GW, but his sale was the enabler that allowed my moves elsewhere.

Worth keeping Vardy forPeter my dear, it's funny that you have such a strong opinion of me based off such little knowledge.

&gt; It would be a waste of time and effort for a developer to "rig" the game 

It's not a waste of time and effort if there is a paid option to be better at the game through better balls or a buy in stake to carry on playing. 

&amp;Ah I guess so to be fair - it just seems all too coincidental for me - you can be chugging along nicely, and then you'll just hit this wall every few months where you will without a doubt lose EVERY single game. Tell me how that can be possible for someone who on average wins just over 50% of games? I never go on a 20-30 game winning streak. Never Lol, I've been playing for a couple of years actually, and this has happened multiple times before.  I've learned to just put the game down and leave it for a few weeks (several times early on I lost all my bank balance and had to grind from nothing).

Also the past few months, there have been spells where i'd lose 4 or 5 in a row perhaps, no 3 sta&gt;if you goal is to maximise points then you should not look at player ownership

I agree entirely with that of course - I just got annoyed by that post a few weeks ago stating that there was no such thing as a differential and you should be looking for the highest scoring players, and only that. Differentials are great, as long as you understandI don't get all this hate surrounding differentials - they are a thing, but there are two scenarios you need to happen - your player needs to score points and the **player you are betting against needs to blank/score low**.

For example I'll use a captain pick - Say Salah vs Trent. 10 teams with both players - 9 of them have 1000 points and captainMate, I can't actually believe the morality of people on here.  Scroll through the comments, and anybody that has asked for some compassion and empathy towards the situation just gets heavily downvoted.

I can't believe we live in a world where having a moral compass is seen as a weakness, and being edgy and abrasive all for the sake of getting a fAs in OP? I do believe that is the case. Some poor soul has been so inconsolable that they've had to go to the extreme of taking their life, and all people can think about is the fact they will have to "endure" people talking about it on social media/the news. I mean, just stay off social media for a few days? Be thankful for for the fact you won'tI know, crazy isn't it.  Every aspect of the show is just bizarre - "Hands up" - Where he just says things - e.g. "Hands up for a new pair of shoes" or "hey, hands up for getting your key in the door first time",  The annoying impressions, Serious Fucking Jockin, every SINGLE day he plays a clip of Alexi Sayle saying "don't forget to say, play RadiI genuinely knew that once this perpetually irritating song had, had it's day on Radio 1 and the like, then he'd one day stumble across and it and say *"Ooo what a great little tune, I bet people will love this inbetween me saying "SHAAAAT AAAAAT" 600 times a day, and my pointless Friday afternoon feature "Serious Jockin'" - which is not actually aI'll tell you what actually, it's a good idea! I think I will :). So, to let you know, this is the last I'll write here now - of course you'll inevitably write back because you can't help yourself, with a speech about how "stupid" I am and your excellent judgement of character based of my 4 Reddit comments about the difference between hypocrisy andOh no! Not a .edu site! Must be totally legit then. 

Do I think you actually give a fuck? Well by your reaction you definitely seem to be a bit wound up by it all. Is it 
perhaps past your bed time Mr Grumpy Pants? Anyway, by saying you don't care, yet seem to be getting in such a tiz, you could say you're being very hypocritical about the whole tFucking hell - stop putting people on a pedestal because they've gone with the preference of someone they've known 2 weeks rather than another person.  It's called personal preference and people are allowed to change their mind when they're seeing someone - in actual fact people can change their mind when they're in a committed relationship as long" But here is the problem with presenting stats in isolation without any context, as they can be used to paint all kinds of pictures which don't necessarily offer any kind of meaningful or accurate insight into a player's ability or their tactical role in any specific system. 

 There are a number of very logical explanations as to why Alexander-ArIt's just a wildly vague statistic that tries to make out that it's all sensational - clickbait at it's finest

The stat apparently actually takes into account cross attempts, passes, and everything like that - and the fact he is so creative and constantly trying to get the ball forward means inevitably he will lose possession on occasion.  I bet tTV is offered as a privilege to inmates, and YES they DO pay a TV licence - £1 a week.

Prison governors are allowed to change the selection of channels if they wish, but they must not exceed nine and subscription serviYeah I've still got Kelly, only just swapped out Lundstram but went for Boly instead, for some reason thought Williams for Man U was nailed with Young leaving but stupid idea as Shaw seems to be first choice - rest of the team is ok, but I have had Fleck for weeks and KDB so that's 2 blanks already for me. 

I need 15 fully playing on most weeks anWith Man City also blanking that week, I'm going to be heavily relying on my bench anyway, I'm not knowingly going to add more strain to it by bringing in a player who I know is not going to be playing that week.  But don't get me wrong, if they weren't blanking then Lundstram would defo have been swapped for another SHU defender.

There are some oDon't get all the praise either - I mean fair play that he likes the girl in the main villa more than any of the new ones so isn't entertaining anything else - that's really up to him. But none of the other guys are bad people for not staying loyal to someone that they have no social commitment to and have known for 3 weeks - again, that's really uBascially you only lose the value if you buy back that player in the later week.

Example - Buy for 9.0, player rises to 10.0, you sell for 9.5 (half the profit you have made), player stays at 10.0 for a few weeks, you buy them back into your team at 10, you are now back where you started with the exact same player, but FPL have taken 0.5 of your mHere we go, one of these ones.

I'm not defending anybody? I'm saying it's not fucking cringey! For god's sake this is satire - SATIRE: the use Then why call the sub "TikTok Cringe"? I think that's a very basic and simple concept to grasp - That a subs name should dictate what the content is - for example, I searched google for a cringey tik tok sub and found this one, subscribed only to find it's not what is described in the name, thus I'm now disappointed.
