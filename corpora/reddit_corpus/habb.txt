these people aren't jokingfor the sword/shield ones, back flip back flip back flip.     chase them when they run off to do a charge or a fire attack.   if it's a charge attack right when they attack, you attack and you usually go under the sword.    for the fire attack just rush them and circle around while hitting them.

>1,000,000,000 divided by 100 (dollars saved per day) = 10,000,000 days
10,000,000 days divided by 365 (days per year) = 27,397.26 years to reach $1 billionbecause he is an awful person?   with how many...let me wiki it...   url

or just all the fraud he has done in his life?     do i need to list his fraud businesses or will you just say "make a business" ??   did i get that about right?

edit: oh wait I forgot about the whole big lie of voting fraud and the billions it's going to charge and bankrupt the companiesagree.    He knew about it jan 2020.   He knew how lethal it was, and discussed it with Bob Woodward.   Bob recorded that conversation.  Many things can be said about Bob holding onto that for so long.     Trump knew.   He fucking knew and denied it was lethal or even a 'thing'.    Fuck trump, he allowed over 550k people die to try and save the "economy"   or rather the stock market.ive wanted to be apart of a d&d or shadowrun campaign since i was maybe 7.    The murders with D&D sparked the satanic panic, i wasnt allowed to do anything with anyone associated with that.    come early 90s, i have a friend with d&d stuff but we were all too young to take it seriously so we just role played our characters.   MAJORLY inspired by dragon warrior for nes.    My parents were very religious which i am not now.kikwear was all too real for me.    i had the 90' bottom pants.   i stole way too much with those jeans.    one of my 'friends' at the time purposely had a tag on the inside of his jeans so we would be stopped at the tag detectors.    i knew they couldn't put hands on me but my pants were full of cds.     the kid tried to get me arrested.    i've had lots of fucked of 'friends' in my life.    i ditched them all of them except 1, 20 years ago.  the last one, i tolerated the trump rhetoric for years but after he invaded the capitol that was it, i had had enough.this is me in the mornings of after drinking the previous night.   i have a hot bath, just sit, listen to cnn or whatever i have tv on.  i'll actually drain the tub when it gets too filled to where i cant lay in the tub anymore.


edit:  yes waste of water.   my utilities are included in my rent.    if i started mining bitcoin im sure id raise some eyebrowsthe people in 'extended' showers are masturbating

fun story, when i was in high school, my sister had a sleep over with her friends.   the next morning one girl was in the shower for an hour and a half and drained 2 full hot water heaters.   me and my friends made fun of her when she got out with the gilligan's island theme song of 'a three hour shower'.   it didn't occur to me until later in life she was masturbatingyou are being obtuse on purpose.    look at the wiki edits.   did i edit those in?    no.    look at the sources.   or do i have to go in and actually paste them to you?
