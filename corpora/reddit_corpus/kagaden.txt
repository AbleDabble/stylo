I think your point is that you thought that it was an overblown hoax before it was right wing.

Didn't age well either way. I'd say about 80% of this virus's profile and danger was known back in Feb. There's been surprisingly little new to it. Long asymptomatI can understand the first part of this... but really, I saw no one flooding the sub back in Feb. I made one of the first posts/comments on it stating there was no way EDC was happening this year. Turns out, mainstream media, CDC, WHO, etc were all lying to you and there was very REAL cause for alarm. Especially to young adults who think they're imSMH... wishing you all good luck getting a refund if you kept your ticket (derp) and good health everyone.

My friends said they kept their ticket to LIB because they love the org and now are bummed because they'll likely never see a penny of it as LIB goes under. Ticketmaster issued almost a billion in bonds (massive debt) that mature in 2027 in oNo one can help us. This is what happens when we have idiots in power who care little for the community and people... these are the people kids in Highschool look up to these days lol. The Surgeon General on TV saying "it's just a flu bro!", disgusting.

Don't worry too much though, this virus will beat everyone into compliance in a couple weeks, aI'm sorry, I love EDC so damn much and this would have been my 10th year. The people, vibe, production value, and music are incredible... the health of the community is more important though. I watched EDC Mexico on stream tearing up knowing this might be the last EDC I see for awhile.

It's really REALLY important for people to know this awful fucYou really have no idea what you're talking about. Your posts and dismissive attitude will not age well or serve you. There's -no way- EDC will be able to go on in May in Las Vegas, unless spread is somehow severely hampered by warm temperatures, but we don't know yet. There are mixed studies on this, and Thailand (hot and humid) has an exponentialThank you for sharing that. I'm not in the medical profession so I don't know what this vow is. It seems reasonable to me though that even with this vow of commitment, there's still a choice in honoring it or not. It feels to me like a situation that boils down to peer social pressure and morale at the end of the day. I'm curious to understand whatThis. There are several reports on body fluids loaded with virus and aerosolized (feces, urine, etc). If this can infect others, you're at ground zero and bringing more virus back in. There's no way it could be positive or even neutral for you.

I don't get how folks think 1 virus pathogen is the same as a million in the body. Pretty fucking stupidIt really depends on how much you use it and your budget. I'll say I didn't use my CV1 very much and was afraid of not using my Index very much either... but so far I've felt much more comfortable and impressed with the Index enough to use it regularly. YMMV but I think it's a great headset and massive step up from the CV1.

All that being said, I I went from a CV1 to an index, it's a massive improvement. I was surprised. I found the CV1 not to be super usable because of the screendoor effect. I did like the touch controllers better than Index at first though. The knuckles controllers out of the box are pretty wonky until the machine learning figures out where your fingers are, then it's likAlready have one, thankfully.

I expect due to the limited supply for scalpers to be snapping these up and hocking them on ebay at 2-3x cost. :( Just checked and it seems like right now they're going for $1300 or so for the full kit.

Based on what we've seen, this thing is going to crush swine flu and it's death rate, and already is at it's point in time. Completed epidemics vs an ongoing one is apples and oranges.

People are trying so damn hard to wish this thing away. Normalcy bias is a powerful thing and the dI've been watching the situation unfold over the past 4 weeks. This cannot and should not be compared to the flu and the folks commenting in this thread are uninformed and have their head in the sand. Normalcy bias and herd behavior is a powerful thing.

I may just delete this thread, I certainly am not thrilled about stroking peoples hate of others here, I took the community as better than thatJust want to say that this is a brilliant marketing move for the following reasons:

1. People are still in the EDC 2019 feels, purchases will likely be more impulsive (like mine)
2. Gives much much more time for full attendance

After doing VIP for the past 5 years, I'm going to say it's lost its luster for us. Gate S did not have VIP entrance and was a complete and total shit-show to get into the event (1.5-2hr wait). VIP Lanyard designs are garbage. Few to no freebies like free coconuts in 2016. Not a huge fan of the additional VIPWife and I do this every night every year.

Good times! You'll love itIn and out of the parking lot is fine. Into the festival with 4 bag checkers for thousands of people was unfathomably poor planning. I protected a small woman who was nearly knocked over and crushed in a stampede the first night. Nights 2 and 3 they put in line barriers. If you got in line at 8:30 you got into the event at 10pm, VIP/GA didn't matteOoh! Something that fired me up this year, glad you asked. Let me give you the perspective of Premier Parking &amp; VIP fail combo for 2018. 

Premier Parking was an absolute shitshow of a line to get in all 3 nights. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen it at Gate S and I've been entering through Gate S since the second night of 2011. The way they As someone who's seen Worlds live 4 times, including this last performance at EDC 2017... I've gotta say....

Take a little accountability for your decisions and grow up from being an entitled litHis set is burned into my mind. If you have it that'd be incredible. I remember he played instruments live one at a time on stage, recorded and looped them, and progressively built the disney song. At first you wouldn't realize the song but then "Oh, it's the Haunted Mansion". The visuals for his set blew my mind too, old disney cartoons snippets tRaveTapes!!! You're a legend! Totally off topic... I donated to you and asked years ago but I think it got swallowed at some point but np. Did you ever have a copy of SKY at the party "X\-ing" back in the late 90's? He did some of the sickest live Disney remixes I've heard to date. I'd die to hear that again! \&gt;\_\&lt; Thanks for all the hard woWhile I was waiting at the porta potties bored and alone, I found a great way to pick up on women coming out by offering them kleenex, wet wipes, and hand sanitizer as they went in/came out. I was swarmed by several ladies at one point all with sincere gratitude. Definitely helped my vibe to socialize, help out, and have fun. I'm going to suggest iAmen CityofChamps!

Not everyone will understand it, though a lot of people in that thread do actually get it and I was surprised at the number of comments that were essentially... "Hey, that looks pretty cool." "They saved a shitload of money." "To hell with stuffy weddings." etc.

Everyone else are deadGate S at times can be a mess for VIP, because there is one entry bottleneck that's fenced off, and when it's crowded we need to cut hundreds of people and get hell from other headliners. Feelsbadman :(

Otherwise, VIP is set up very well my wife and I. Only other thing to add was attendants in the restroom a few years back were awesome for VIP, I Full sets like were done in 2014, or Tomorrowland/Ultra would be amazing. I had a question around potentially purchasing live sets in a collectors blu-ray as well in the thread buried somewhere too. &lt;3 I think the fans (especially the ones who can't go) would love it! My wife and I groove to past EDC full sets to get hype for next years event orHi Pasquale, thank you for the amazing events. My wife and I were married @ EDC LV 2016, and did the Skydeck experience all three nights this year. We love EDC!!! Thank you for keeping the oldschool 90's PLUR vibe alive.

The past two years, I've aggregated videos from EDC on reddit. Some of these have been professional videos released by DJs, someWife and I were married at EDC last year. It was awesome, we had about 20 friends and 10 new friends at the festival show up. We did not have a typical ceremony when we came back home, our families did want us to though that wasn't our style and they're cool with it now. Not for everyone but we'd definitely recommend it! Everyone said it was THE moI'm almost 40, raved in the 90's burned out by 2000, quit everything to focus on my career, came back in 2011 and learned it was me, not the scene that burned out. Now I can manage it and have been to EDC Vegas every year since. I was married there last year. We have the time of our lives every one and live PLUR. :) 

What I've learned: 

- Bring tThank you for the sweet comment, we love you too!!! You're absolutely right, it's not about the "stuff" at all... pretty much all of it is destroyed by the end of the night anyways. It's about sharing, spreading the love, and getting people to see people they may not know differently. Being open to those around them because HEY! you may be surpriseSkydeck was alright if you kinda expect what you're getting into. It's expensive as fuck, full of chinese money, the women are 70% hired escorts, and the attitude is a little obnoxious. 

The nice thing is that you get a table to sit at with an OK view, an alcohol spend every night, so if you like to drink at EDC... you'll have PLENTY to drink. TheHappens every year! Be sure to return the favor if you have a chance on your next EDC :)

Last year, I found a phone on the ground, walked 15 feet and found a group with a flashlight looking around aimlessly at the ground. I asked them what they dropped. They said a phone. I asked them what kind. They said an Iphone 6. I pulled it out of my pocket A couple of things I picked up with my SPIN GOGGLES:

* "The big reveal" is going to be something fairly stupid at entrance gate C &amp; D that is not restricted to premier parking holders. They're just trying to sell gate C &amp; D over gate S.

* The "additional lane southbound" sounds like it was the Premier Parking lane. Which was used last yeaIt's awesome! My wife and I do it every year. 

* Being coherant

* Time doesn't go by in a blur, festival feels longer

* Remembering the finer details afterwards

* Waking up feeling like a million bucks the next day

* Stamina to do all three days with no problem

I definitely recommend you try it. The contact buzz from the crowd and red bull isHmm, I can definitely see the problem of artists working hard and putting a set together and using it multiple times in the festival circuit. Personally, a video'ed experience would never replace the awe, vibe, fun and feeling of actually being there. We've seen artists multiple times with the same sets because we were so blown away.
