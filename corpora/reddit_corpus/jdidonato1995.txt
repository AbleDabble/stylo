&gt;Omnipotence has never included to ability to do the logically impossible.

Omnipotence is **logically** impossible. 

This whole response makes no sense. Why do **I** have to prove that an omnipotent God is in fact omnipotent? 

Omnipotence would imply full control over the plasticity of logic meaning he could always have chosen an infinite numRight but neither of these even have to be the case. God could absolve us of all responsibility and leave us in bliss as if we were in heaven or something and there would be no ramification because God controls reality. 

Since God doesn't, God's morals come into question. 

His trustworthiness is what I'm getting at. I don't think we should trust My understanding of God is that no such God exists but that doesn't pertain to the conversation. 

From a religious perspective, God **could** make reality better and doesn't. Why? I don't know. &amp; Since I'll never know, what we're left with is reality and the idea that God is omnipotent. So, if God's omnipotent, why isn't reality better? It's n&gt;G-d can do it all. What's your point now?

That God should do it all &amp; doesn't even though God can. &amp; That since that's true, God isn't to be trusted. 

I don't expect anything from a deity personally because I'm not religious. 

But for religious people, it's important to question the morality of your God, as I think it may be evident &gt;A spoiled kid who was denied of their desires to discipline them would throw a tantrum and accuse their parents that they aren't loving. Is this actually the case or is the spoiled kid speaking from his own ignorance on why he is being denied of pleasures?

An abusive parent who denied their child of food medicine water &amp; civilization, or w&gt;1. Define what "immoral" means in your worldview

Actions/decisions/failure to act in situations that are largely agreed upon by the majority of humanity to have been in bad faith and done to deliberately cause harm. 

&gt;2. Define what standard you're using to arrive at this conclusion and what moral compass you're using, since there are so m&gt;Also, the explanation you've given is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why would god do bad things to people (if he in fact would do it). Human brain is incapable of appreciating the good without the bad. we need contrast. If every single event in our life is good, then nothing is really good. We have no frame of reference.

But God could&gt;But we're equally justified to argue that if God allows for happiness, &amp; if that happiness is immoral, that God's word could be trusted.

Why? 

&gt;And from my perspective suffering isn't immoral. I am not an immoral person while I am suffering or because I am suffering. 

My argument is that the divine manifestation of suffering is immora&gt;Sin is just willing something contrary to God's will. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong in constructing that definition, do you?

If God's will isn't trustworthy, then I do see something inherently wrong with that definition of sin. 

&gt;Are you sure He could have? Can you prove this?

I can't **prove** anything about God. But, m&gt;Thanks for the downvotes, for whoever is doing it.

Wasn't me. I've upvoted you to try and compensate. 

&gt;Now, on to your question! Why did God define sin? Because God is perfect, and expects righteousness from His creatures that He made in His Image.

Then why wouldn't God manifest righteousness within his creatures that he made from his im&gt;You're also not considering that God may exist but not be tri-omni. Remove one single omni and you have a perfect explanation for why bad stuff happens.

Fair argument here. Best one I've seen. If God cannot do all, doesn't know all, and isn't everywhere, then God may be able to absolve themself of **some** responsibility, but, this would *stil&gt;my parents carefully neglected me and respected me as an independent rational being and not a dumb puppy incapable of coping with reality.

Sorry for the double reply should've put this in the first comment: 

Your parents didn't create the (external) reality of life around you. The state of the whole world/universe and what happens was far out&gt;If God were responsible for every bad thing in my life, then they would be responsible for every good thing in my life, too.

And that's to God's credit but I don't think it makes for much of a rationalization or justification for the fact that he's still directly responsible for all the bad. 

&gt;Personally I don't think that God cares about &gt;to call it a big issue in this country is honestly wrong. While you have a huge number of people still protesting for racial inequality. Majority of American citizens are against racism, so it is not an issue.

Most Americans aren't racist but the ones that are find themselves in a position of authority (for example, like cops) to impose their No. 

You come full circle from where you are at, and realize, that while class struggle **is** a common problem between people who suffer from *racism* and people who *don't*, that also racism is it's own struggle the likes of which poor white people (in the US, specifically &amp; especially) do not understand.

Like I said. Bad management. Someone hasn't noticed. 

&gt;I strongly doubt this is true. My guess is that like everything else, 80% of the value comes from 20% of the workers and everyone else just gets in the way.

The 80/20 rul&gt;Nope, not true. Plenty of bad employees deliver negative concrete value who are still employed in businesses doing very well.

Just a matter of time until somebody nips that in the bud, though. 

Employees maintain a positive concrete value as a whole. You're bringing up odd cases of under productive employees to prove your point. I'm talking aHow do those not jive? They're almost repetitions of the same statement: 

Employees earn a fraction of their concrete value and **that is the employer-employee relationship in a nutshell** 

We are having a miscommunication somehow. 

&gt;You just said they all pay a fraction of the value, and immediately followed it up with a statement that if th&gt;There is a massive distinction between being paid a fraction of potential value vs. concrete value.

Well you're right, but it's important that we made that distinction because before that you said it didn't even exist, which, it certainly does. 

I mean I'm not trying to have an argument about the **semantics** around the word value. If you hiNot sure when I agreed that no one should be paid off their objective value... 

My whole argument was that most people are in fact **hired** based on their potential value, and, that in a case of no/lost profits, that employee is still compensated (the root of your original argument) and that that compensation (versus termination of employment) is&gt;Are you making the argument that you should be paid the full 'potential value' of labor? That's nonsensical. 

Nope. I'm saying that the trade between an employer and an employee is the difference between the potential revenue that the employer can earn off the employees labor and the employee's wage. 


&gt;They are only operating off their suThere is absolutely such a thing as potential value as it pertains to our conversation. 

If you hire me, and I value myself at, say, $30/hr, that's because my skill set(s), if utilized by my company correctly, can **potentially** earn the company far more than they ever paid me. 

But the company still has to point my *potential ability to generat&gt;If a company hires you at $1,000 and they end up making nothing, the worker still gets the $1,000.

&amp; the reason that the employee could justify that price of $1k is because they provide *multiple times that value* in, as said before, an irreplaceable skillset, etc. 

If the company doesn't profit, that doesn't mean that the employee *isn't&gt;If you want to value yourself at $1,000 per hour, you will need to have irreplaceable skills of great value in a market that generates great profit.

So...you have to have skills *that provide value to the business*...&amp; once you've done so, *you are paid a fraction of that value?* 

Wouldn't that prove the idea OP is trying to disprove? 

H&gt;Urban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community.

But yeah qui&gt;If this were the case than why do so many police departments have issues hiring enough officers? There may be an abundance of people qualified to do the job but they know the difficulties and would not put themselves in that position.

Well yeah. They're qualified but aren't *morally bankrupt* like I already said, so they won't take the job, de&gt;We can agree to disagree about whether they are all morally bankrupt and whether the do good or not.
