&gt;I see that as fascism

Then you don't really have any understanding of what the word fascism means.

This isn't nit-picking either, it's important.  If you people think that fascism means "liberal capitalism", then they're much more receptive to fascist talking points.  What is featured in this post is disgusting and evil, but it isn't fascist.the picture doesn't depict "equivalence" at all, it's just a list of things, some which are broadly accepted by society, and others which aren't

even if it were depicting "levels", which it doesn't appear to be, it's not about "how racist" something is, but about how socially acceptable it is.  That said, the items below the line don't seem to be Also, as for writing in a dialect, a lot of the time when people want to write "black", they use a lot of apostrophes to indicate the "missed" letters and eye spellings, as if AAVE is just "broken" English. The reality is that, since the English alphabet is already so non-phonemic, representing dialect variation in spelling is almost impossible to I guess it depends on your starting assumption. If you assume the most uncharitable interpretation possible (i.e. that the person must be a fucking idiot) and don't question it, then I suppose you can misread it.

Even then though, I don't really see how you could look at this picture and think it was a hierarchy... "Calling the police on black peoI don't see how it can be interpreted like that lol, it's clearly a "tip of the iceberg" metaphor...

Also, even if that wasn't obvious to you, what, you think that the creator of this picture thinks that "the N-word" and "swatstikas" are somehow worse than the KKK?

It's clearly just a 2 section diagram where 1 is socially acceptable and the other1) Because I don't speak that dialect

2) Because the written standard of a language is rarely the same as the vernacular form. While I might write a reddit comment in a way that is more similar to the spoken form of the language than, say, an essay or job application letter might be, nevertheless the words that are coming from my fingers now take a dialect of English, specifically, non-standard or dialectical grammar, more specifically still, a difference in third-person verb inflections. 

Even when it comes to vocabulary, there's a difference between "slang" and a "dialect word".  

In an American context (especially re: black Americans) they're often conflated (often conflating the wholeJust gonna pick out a small bit of this comment because, as an English teacher &amp; linguist it's something that interests me:

&gt;you're so articulate" is often considered a microaggression, as if to imply that actually, the person saying this is expressing covert bigotry of low expectations by subtly presupposing that the POC speaking is an excIt's not really technically correct to call it "slang".  Slang is usually used to refer only to lexis (i.e. vocabulary), it's informal words and phrases that go in and out of fashion, often regional and often only used by the young. Thot/yeet/no cap etc. are slang, recent, informal, fashionable vocabulary opaque to outsiders.

These features of AAVit's just you, it happens all the time. Black people who speak in a dialect of English historically associated with white America are regarded as being more "well-spoken" and therefore also more "educated" or intelligent. It's not rare for black folk who speak in Standard American English to be complimented on their "well-spoken"-ness, especially iUsing "beginning" and "end" for objects doesn't seem odd to me, but that might just be me. How would you say it, if not with *beginning*?

I'm assuming that "end" is fine for you as in "the end of the world".

"the beginning of the car" sounds weird to me but more because it's odd to see "the car" in the abstract without context.  If we were watchiI don't think you really understood the point I'm making though.

The pagan spring festival was dedicated to Eostre, and was celebrated in Ēosturmōnaþ (i.e. "Easter Month").

If the Christian festival took its traditions from the pagan Spring Festival, *and* took its name from the Spring Festival month which itself took its name from the festival'sI can see why you would think that 

"If you found" and "If you were to find" are different ways of saying the same thing.

In the second example, *were* is the verb inflected to the past subjunctive (hypothetical tense), and *to find* is the infinitive.

When you have two verbs like that, you only inflect the first one.

It's a bit like how you woAlso, if a Brazilian is spending their time writing reddit comments in English, there's a very good chance they're an upper middle class white Brazilian with a Europe/America inferiority complex, and fear/disdain for the working class of their own country.

If your exposure to Brazilians is online Brazilians speaking English, or Brazilians you met &gt;Your balanced view has about as much chance of achieving anything as Elizabeth Warren moderate radicalism.

It's easy and compelling to reduce problems to binaries and put yourself on the correct side of the binary, but something being compelling doesn't make it correct.

It's also easy (and frankly facile) to paint anyone calling out any bullsDude, do you speak English?

&gt;You were trying to rid us of the fact that any tone in politics refers to a particular political framework defining the tone.

Not in the idiomatic compound adjective "tone-deaf", it doesn't, and I have explained multiple times what it means. I'm sorry, it's not an argument, what you're saying about is just wrong, aI'm not arguing for neoliberal identity politics, I'm arguing against you.  The rhetorical trick is to pretend that those two things are necessarily the same.

The false dichotomy is that there is only one way to to be opposed to neoliberalism/idpol/identitarianism basically, your way.

There's the false dichotomy.  

As an example, 1 way to oppose&gt;The problem with this is you're essentializing idpol as self-evident as musical notes, and splitting the difference with etymology referent. 

I'm literally not doing that and you are being thick as **fuck** right now.  I'm just describing what Michael Brooks was saying in response to a blatant misreading.

&gt;Describe a concrete scenario wherI'm literally not tying it to music.  Re-read my comment.

I'm referring to the idiomatic usage of a word whose *etymology* is amusia, but whose meaning outside of that context is "speaking or behaving in a way that is offensive or repulsive to people, while being unaware of that fact".  That is **what tone-deaf means**.  Here it means *that*, and &gt;If you're reverting to a literal interpretation as a rhetorical strategy

Good thing that I'm not then.

Tone-deafness is a metaphor with an established and understood idiomatic meaning. In order to argue with someone, it's important to accurately address what they're actually saying, not misunderstand them or put words in their mouth. That has&gt;You can go *with* the idpol bullshit which is by far and away the dominant narrative, or you can go *against* it.

Like the rest of your comments, this is just a bullshit and completely meaningless false dichotomy, and I'm getting sick of this repetitive contentless rhetorical bluster.

Of course we're both against the dominant liberal identitamy point was that the idiom "tone deaf" doesn't mean *"deaf to the prevailing narrative"*, which is what the commenter implied it means, it means *"being unpleasant and repellent without even knowing that's what you're doing"*, which is a completely different meaning.  

&gt;It's not like the economic left are bad musicians, are choosing the wrong modification of foreign names is hardly the unique preservation of the English lol

I don't object when Brazilians "lusitanize" my name, or when Japanese speakers "nipponize" it, it's literally universal.

And in fact I quite enjoy that I have a slightly different name whenever I start speaking in a new language.

Not gonna dox myself, but just preIt depends what "picked up a bit of Gullah" means right?  She could imitate the pronunciation of a few sentences and knows a few dialect words? Or she can accurately construct phrases in a way that authentically represents the language.

I could well be wrong, but I would imagine a white southerner who "picked up a bit" of gullah might well be more&gt; on reddit you get massacred for being centrist on any sub

That's more because most people who call themselves "centrists" actually have strong ideological positions that they don't themselves acknowledge as being political.  Also, there's a certain intellectual cowardice with just "both sides"-ing an issue, sometimes there are right and wrong&gt;even if I disagree with most of your ideology.

If you found it surprising that this is a far-left subreddit, perhaps you haven't been given a very accurate impression of what "most of this ideology" is.

Perhaps not, I don't mean to presume what you do or don't know, but it's just a word of warning: if your main view of a group of people comesNah fuck that, sincerity and triteness are not the same thing.

I think that's the reason Michael Brooks' death really hit me. It wasn't just that I found him an interesting person with valuable insights and commentary, I genuinely admired him on a personal level, for the reasons you describe, and I thank you for articulating it. 

It's certainly s&gt;There's no room for "let's try to avoid tone-deaf economic reductionism"

what are you even trying to say here?  What, race is *never* relevant to the discussion, and racial issues should *never* even be discussed let alone resolved?

&gt;Tone-deaf economic reductionism means someone is governing the tone.

No it fucking doesn't. Tone-deaf is a&gt;So why can't we use the same thing with my sentence ? 

You *are* using it in your sentence :)  I avoided the word "subjunctive" because the verb inflection we use for "hypothetical present and future" is usually called the **"subjunctive past"**, even though it **isn't used for the past**, which can be confusing, so I think I'll use other termgoing to post this as a side note, because I don't want it to clutter up my actual answer with this tangent and derail it:

For hypotheticals (or "subjunctives" if you prefer), in formal English you can use "were" instead of "was" for "hypothetical present/future", but for all other cases (e.g. "ate", "came", "played", "knew"), the verbform is the I would say you've got a bit of time mixing there, the first part of the conditional refers to a non-past hypothetical, the latter to a past hypothetical .

It's not the end of the world, and if it represents dialogue then it's realistic, people often don't plan ahead and end up splicing their tenses in real speech.  

I might, off the top of my heOK so... that doesn't really work because "inflated to the bottom" isn't an idiom that applies to jokes, but I see what you mean.

Also, we don't usually say "a joke on" but "a joke about"

Perhaps you could link an actual tweet instead (or even better, a few) 

As for "correcting this ambiguity", I'm not really sure what you mean, what's to correcin non-rhotic accents (like mine), it would be "there" with a schwa on the end.  Like "woulda" and "coulda" for "would've" and "could've", "there're" sounds like "there-uh"

e.g. "There're some good reasons to seriously consider that option." (there-uh-some good...) 

the word-final r may get re-introduced if followed by a vowel though, e.g. "there[Coincidentally, I wrote a long-ass comment about the use of the past continuous yesterday, here.

**It's impossible to tell whether the sentence you gave was a good choice of construction without a little more context.** In *most* cases, I would agree with you, the way the sentence was formulated carries an implication that the character soIt's evidently clear to everyone in this thread apart from you that the questioner was referring the the *genesis* of modern Hebrew and whether the Hebrew as it was introduced could be considered a constructed language or whether it would be considered a descended dialect of a natural language.  i.e., was modern Hebrew in its original conception as&gt;Children do not learn "rules of grammar" like you learn in school (and the rules of grammar you learned in school are wrong), children's brains deduce rules of grammar (mapping from what Chomsky calls deep structure to surface structure) from what they hear.

"If children begin speaking a constructed language natively then actually it's not a constructed language any more so no." is not an answer to the question, it's just a way of dodging it.

This is sometimes contested, but it was probably (at least, so the Greeks themselves said it)Yo, it's kinda late for me to answer your question right now about "subtenses" etc., but let me just point you in a good direction.  Some words to look for are "tense", "aspect", and "mood".

Depending on who you ask, English has "2 tenses, and 4 aspects", "3 tenses and 4 aspects", or "12 tenses".  I would expand on this but it's late, and I figure sorry if my reply that seemed flippant, I started writing out a comment listing the problems but it was taking too long. Most of the descriptions are completely wrong. There are 2 on the whole graphic that you could call "correct", but even then the example given doesn't demonstrate it. The rest are all some degree of wrong, more than half are com*part 2: n.b.:- potential pitfalls*

1) Just because the continuous aspect is used for actions not states, doesn't mean that the converse is true.  The continuous aspect can only be used for actions, but the simple aspect can be used for actions **and** states.  This means that the simple aspect can be more ambiguous.

Take a word like "have".  It'Great question! These are the types of questions I love when my students ask in classes (and that I used to dread when I was a new teacher haha!)

Allow me to answer your question with a question, why would we choose to use the continuous instead of the simple in your case? What difference is there in what we're communicating about her.

I'll use tAre you a native speaker looking to understand the English language more, or a non-native English learner? 

The reason I ask is because you would be interested in different reading material depending on your perspective. 

If the latter, what's your first language? That question's less important, I'm just being curious ;) (you don't have to answerI would advise you to ignore this graphic entirely. Most of the descriptions are so vague as to be meaningless/useless, and some of them are just wrong.

As for your question (unlike what is claimed in this graphic), the past continuous and present perfect continuous are very different constructions with very different uses.

I'm not trying to be rude or mean, it's just that the above graphic is mostly wrong. It covers 12 completely different constructions, gets them mostly wrong, and doesn't give any helpful advice on how to use them. It would take me hours to write aThese graphics may be nice to look at and give the feeling of "professionalism" and "information", but they rarely give any clarity on how to actually use English constructions.

This one is unfortunately no exception, no non-native speaker could read this and come away with a clearer idea of how to use the constructions featured.

I'll admit that, some of us Europeans do often have a tendency to paint and view America quite monolithically in a way that we wouldn't so readily accept about ourselves.  That said, I also think Americans are for the most part naPut it this way: if a friend of mine wears a type of shirt, or cut of jeans or something that they never usually wear, and I say "That shirt looks good on you, you should wear that type of cut more often." then I'm not simply politely expressing that I like the shirt, I'm saying that it *objectively* looks good on him, and so he should wear clothesDoes should ever express an obligation?  It’s more “would be a good idea to” or “would be right to” right?  I can’t think of any situation where *should* expresses an obligation like “must” or “have/has to”

I do see *should* often being misunderstood by non-native speakers as much stronger than it actually is a lot, this is the first time I’ve beeAs a mid-20s speaker of British English, I would only ever say "you should" if actually expressing what someone *should* do, i.e. what would be the right thing for someone to do in that situation.
