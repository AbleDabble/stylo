My beard grows the same way; much thicker on the chin. I think *many* men are like this.

I don’t *feel* hotter, but I definitely *feel* a greater confidence within because of the beard. 

As far patches, they can easily be remedied by growing the beard longer. I know many men that have patches in the first several weeks but if a man can discipline himself for 90 days, it often times is the solThank you.

✅ [Day 30 to Day 60:](url) On my **30th day** II mean, you *could* just let the neck line go if your beard gets to a really long length since nobody is seeing it; however, even when I had my beard [longer than this](url) I still trimmed my neck line **every couple of weeks** when I was trimming my cheek lines.

Honesty, it doesn’t take more than a *few minutes* and it’s super low maintenance, sNot an odd question at all; definitely a good one.

The #1 clip I came across was from **George Bruno**, the “Sultan of Silver”, I originally [shaved it off](url) when COVID19 was just beginning to ramp up and I wanted my mask to fit snug. 

However, the day I shaved it is the day I looked into the mirror and said, *“No way I can look at this mug in the mirror every morning”*, so I started my 90 day beard journey.

Beard hair grows, on average, about a **1/2 inch per month**, so you’ve gotta tap into the *patience aspect* of the beard journey and allow those hairs to not only grow, but to eventually *drop down*.

Now, when it comes to your beard, simply trim the cheek line just a bit, then the lower portion of your beard as it makes its way to your chin and it’ll actually look fuller. 

Overall, you’ve been patient over the span of three months and now you have an opportunity to make the beard look like thThe first 30 days I literally did *nothing* to it; just let it grow. 

It wasn’t pretty, but because I was wearing a mask to work at FedEx, I could get away with it. 

Plus, I wanted to see what my face looked like without a trim for the first month. It was sheer curiosity, knowing I probably wouldn’t get away with doing this again. 

I didn’t trimFour weeks in and you’ve got *fantastic* looking beard growth, combined with *exceptional* cheek and neck lines. Be proud. Many men would die for this at four weeks.

Give that lower portion a bit more time (hair growth is on average about a **1/2 inch** per month) and you’ll notice the hairs will begin to naturally fall south. 

At that point is wThanks. I actually used a straight razor for the very first time (I’m 44) last night to trim my neck and cheek line. 

I had just a little bit of hair north of where it is currently and the straight razor — though extremely intimidating initially — came in *really* handy to touch up the cheek line. 

It’s amazing how much more you can see using a sI’m definitely happy the beard has a good pace about it. Haha. 

Knowing what I had before helps me immensely this time around. 

When a guy grows his beard out for the first time — with a goal of going a few months — it’s always a guessing game as to what it’s gonna look like. 

That element has been removed and I’m excited to get back to “normal”Thanks. 👊🏻

I went with the *“two fingers above the Adam’s apple”* and I think it paid off well. 

I never have the worry about shaving my beard to high and getting the ol’ chin strap; it’s the other option of having it *too low* that I’ve been trying to balance. 

My goal is a medium size beard with a handlebar by the 90th day, so I’ll keep the neI honestly can’t remember. 🤷🏻‍♂️

I literally learned about the “one or two fingers above the Adam’s apple” neck trim just recently...and it makes a ton of sense for guys with shorter beards. 

Part of me wants to return to [this length ](url)which will allow me to keep it where it’s currently at, since it’ll be eventually covered in a few months. Here’s my advice, from a 44 year old man who has grown a pretty good size beard:

Don’t touch your face with a razor for at least 30 days...especially in these unprecedented days in which you can stay home or wear a mask when you go out, not having to worry about what you look like. 

For a two week beard, I would honesty say that it has potential.A little background:

Give Barry’s Gold (red box) and Barry’s Irish Breakfast (green box) a try. 

Barry’s Irish Breakfast is a bit smoother, at least to me. Either of them will hit the spot as far as strength is concerned. 

As far as ‘breakfast teas’ the strength chart goes like this:

I can’t even begin to tell you the amount of FedEx customers who feel the need to open their front doors to greet me when I pull my truck up to their house. Old habits die hard.

All three of my kids LOVED my beard and were very proud of me, even having their friends say how much they liked my beard. Made this Dad feel pretty good about himself. 

2002 is a loooooooong time ago to be completely clean shaven. Wow. My last time was 2009 and yes, it is such Thanks.

I don’t think there is enough space to write out the various things I did, read, viewed and purchased over the years to make my beard the way it *was*. 

So sad to use my beard in *past tense*. 😥

Feel free to click my Reddit profile and view a few of my pics where I responded in greater detail to various beard questions. 

I will say thisThanks. Just went over and took a look at your beard; we both are definitely similar...especially the salt &amp; pepper. 😏

It is certainly a DRASTIC change — one that my three kids (16, 14, 11) do NOT like. Haha! 

I don’t regret my decision one bit because of the circumstances, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t miss how it made me look and This is where I’m so confused: I’m looking for that “connection” or “bridge” in my tree from Ireland to Scotland and I’m not seeing anything...not one single Irish relative. I’ve taken a fine tooth comb to the family tree and came up with the fact that my great, great grandmother was born in Scotland and from her I go clear back to the 1300’s withoI’ve been able to track my Scottish side all the way back to the 1300’s. 

My mother’s father’s side goes clear into Scotland around the 1860’s and there isn’t one single person from Ireland and yet dozens upon dozens of my relatives who were born, baptized, married and buried in the Perth area of Scotland. 

Does this make me Scottish then by DNA?You’ll be shocked at how a patchy beard can look pretty decent if given time. 

Seriously, give your beard a solid three months of no trimming to see if those patches can be covered by longer, more ‘combable’ hairs.

I began really losing my hair in my late 20’s and decided it was time to retire from the barbershop, purchase some WAHL clippers and do it myself once a week.  

The amount of money I’ve saved in a decade and a half is mindbGood question. 

I never shaved that area under my bottom lip; I used a beard trimmer on a short level and just went over the entire goatee once a week. 

When I started growing out my beard last year, I noticed that the longer hair simply covered those gaps and filled it right in. 

The same thing applies to men who have trouble growing hair on thNow, why can’t other Scots react like this?!?!

I’ve come across a *ton* of trolls, downers and ‘fun police’ by posting this here on r/beards and r/scotland.
