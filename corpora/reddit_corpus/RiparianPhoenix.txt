My immediate response is that they probably made more than they’re saying.

But...there probably really isn’t a huge market for larges amount of gold anymore. The economy in the main game is incredibly flooded, the average player can make more than enough by doing basic farms, players who do want more learn how to play the auction house, and there That’s true to an extent, but there have been some great communities out there that actually have constructive discussions.

Often in those forums, the whiny complainers spouting bullshit get ignored or called out. This place is almost entirely the worst and whiniest people congregating in one corner of the internet though. 

It’s bloody awful. I hFirst of all: brand new edition. We don’t know what is going to be played right now. 

Secondly: other aspects have seen plenty of play even in recent years. Avengers, Hunters, Reapers even Dragons and Spiders in some periods of time. Hawks have been used. People have used banshees too. There are contextual moments when certain units become better I don’t want to come back. The user base is awful and have unreasonable expectations. 


The people are whiny complainers who don’t have a clue about the game. They fixate on bullshit narratives and minor complaints rather than actually thinking. 

I’m responding to you now, but I’m not coming back to this sub. It’s not worth the time. I’m not the I just hate Reddit tbh. I really don’t care much for the average Redditor. 

I think they’re whiny and entitled people who fixate on negatives.

It’s annoying and frustrating because there is no constructive discussion. Is just people bitching who only want to hear other people bitch. 

This has to be one of the absolute worst gaming forums I have Truth. 

It seems a lot of people have a very hard time grasping this. 

I honestly think that it is too abstract of a concept for some people. You need be able to think larger scale about the situation and be able to grasp chains of cause and effects of a wide array of multiple factors. Economics are complicated. 

It’s ***waaay*** easier to say cDude. It’s just simple supply and demand. 

People with specialized skill sets and experience in the industry are in far higher demand so businesses have to pay more to attract them. 

Average kid out of school without those skills and experience and just his degree are incredibly plentiful. They’re everywhere now, so they don’t have nearly the sam&gt;Eldar have been competitive riding off the backs of a few overpowered models for years. 

Fuck this stupid narrative. No more so than just about any other competitive army, and if any thing, they’ve actually had the most diversity over the years. This idea you’re trying to push is absolute bullshit. I’ve been with the hobby for 20 years and it I’m actually mostly okay with where the Eldar are right now. I think an update is necessary since the current codex is so old, but an overhaul is definitely not needed. The units that need to be looked at are the aspects and I really don’t think they’re far off from being decent. The wraithknight and Phoenix Lords definitely needs to be redesigned After being with the hobby for 20 years, I’m just going to chalk it up to GW being GW. Every edition and every year brings disappointments and dissatisfaction. Every codex, every rules set people question why they do what they do. No one knows. They get shit wrong all the time, they make weird choices, they never match the rules to the fluff. 

ThaI think you’re in fine shape so far. 

DEldar are kind of unique in that they are essentially three small armies in one. Expect to run three patrol detachments in 9th instead of a battalion. We have the Kabals, the Cults and the Covens, with each bringing different strengths. 

We’re in a weird spot moving between editions right now and a lot of whlol

From economist, world news from around the world and history. 

You’re pretty ignorant on a lot.

The West is increasingly being seen by much of the world as inconsistent, unstable and weak. Developing nations outside of EU and Commonwealth are moving closer towards the Chinese model. Even the EU and Australia are increasing their trade with CI know Xenos get pushed to the side stage, but Eldar easily get the most attention out of the lot. 

Ynnari are actually the main story plot running for the race right now and are connected to Bobby G. I think it’s a fair bet that they’ll be revisited in the future, it’s just a matter of when and how. 

I’m still sad about the Corsairs getting forgIt’s the larger underlying design philosophy of it. Rather than creating an epic and engrossing world that allows the players the freedom to interact with it how they want, they force layers upon layers of overly designed systems on top of it all. They take things too far and suffocate the game rather than giving it the freedom to breathe and allowThat’s not constructive at all and is completely and unnecessarily condescending. 

Not every army has the tools to accomplish every strategy or tactic effectively. Tau have unfortunately been a one trick pony and GW has never given them any form of resilient vanguard type units necessary to hold objectives in this game, nor do they have particularI think it’s probably a little of both.

This is still in the hype phase for most people. It’s early beta and people are still hopeful and excited. It’s the opportunity for positive changes and a new experience. 

Then there are the people who read a little bit here and there. They see a new power or two they want to try. They think about how cool No, I’m in the same boat as that guy. 

I was feeling super hyped for Shadowlands. I’ve watched a lot of streams and videos throughout the alpha and beta periods, and I can honestly say: the more I see of Shadowlands, the less hyped I am. 

I know someone will try to justify it as me losing my excitement because I’m getting tired of watching contenWhy does it matter realistically though? The only time it is relevant is during deck construction, and at that time they are sorted by class anyway.  A dual class card will appear in each class’s section. 

In game, there are no cards that will directly interact with cards based on that quality. The only time the class identity is ever relevant is Here are some things for you to consider...

Much of the rest of the world is moving towards China, not us.

The West is currently in turmoil while China is projected to become the next major super power as the US is falling. They see China as successful and stable and are either starting to model themselves more like them and/or increasing trade wLMAO

No, they don’t, you young, naive and idealistic fool. 

Much of the rest of the world is moving towards China, not us. 

The West is currently in turmoil while China is projected to become the next major super power as the US is falling. The see China as successful and stable. 

The West’s experiment of multiculturalism and diversity is seen Yep. China could not not give less of a fuck about the west’s modern ideas about diversity and inclusive as. 

You call them racist and their response will be “so?”  

They don’t care about the same things. The very modern western idea that diversity is a strength is not that way in China. 

Condemn them if you want, but they see strength in unity.Then what do you want? 

If the deck isn’t a problem at higher ranks and only played at lower ranks, it’s not getting nerfed. 

People have told you how to play against it less and it’s not even hard. You still don’t want to do it though. 

Do you just want to complain for the sake of complaining? 

Btw, the new rank system is fantastic and a huge I don’t know, this card might be good enough to just run on it’s own.

1 mana spells are really easy to play, so the combo is pretty reliable. The freeze effect is already decent for control and tempo decks, but adding the 3 damage makes it cheap potential spot removal. 

Both Mage and Rogue love this kind of effect especially at 1 mana. I really tI’ve also just watched how my dad’s massive Blood Angels army has been replaced with an entirely new line of figures. That shit really sucks. Thousands of dollars worth of models replaced and outshined by brand new figures and it killed his entire interest. 

If Eldar get the same treatment, I’d probably feel the same. If they invalidate my collectI think there are trade offs to it. 

While I think it would be great to get a bit more attention, I honestly think Space Marines get *too much*, and I don’t just mean relative to everyone else. I mean I would have a hard time keeping up with that release schedule. 

I also think it could be frustrating to constantly have your rules change. It can Seems like a fine edition to me. Falcons, walkers, and vypers are all good  now. Our wave serpents are still great. This is looking to be a potentially good edition for our wraith, outside of the knight. Our flyers and shining spears are still good. Our psykers’ point costs were barely touched. 

Starcannons are relatively cheap and amazing at poppRight? Doesn’t make sense at all. It’s an alien creature. 

To be fair though, nothing about the set makes sense from a canon lore perspective. There’s no way most of the races would make sense to ever study at Scholomance.

Hearthstone only takes inspiration from WoW. It doesn’t care at all about staying true to that world and exists entirely sepaI highly recommend more wave serpents. They’re absolutely one of our best models and one of the best tanks in the game.  They’re looking to be even more important in 9th. 

I would also recommend some Wraithblades. They’re the most durable infantry we have access to and seem like they’re going to important for contesting objectives this edition. ThHey. I believe it was included in the new points and is now 210 before weapons and upgrades. TBH, I don't know if it will see too much play. I love the model, but it's a bit high on the point costs to take when compared to other options, especially with the changes to formations. 

I really hope it doesn't get moved to Legends haha. I have a lot ofI’ve often taken a  small squads of Dragons. In the editions when they’re point effective, they’re very good at destroying that one thing that absolutely must die.  

I know some people have gotten use out of Banshees, but I’ve generally felt the points were better spent in other ways. That probably came down to playstyle preferences though. Beside&gt;Aspect Warriors need a complete rework.

I totally agree. They’re still from a universe and game where the Tactical Marine was the standard benchmark that all other infantry were compared to.  The game has changed significantly since then. 

While they’ve currently lost their niche, the introduction of elite infantry like the custodes and varioI agree that GW are shit at balancing and writing rules. I whole heartedly agree with that. We could go on for days about all of their questionable choices over the years, but that will still never change the nature of competition. Something will be the best. 

I have played a multitude of games and sports competitively over the years. The whole puAs someone who has been with the game since third edition and started as a Biel-Tan player: our aspects have rarely been good. 

Dark Reapers have been almost the sole exception to that. Dire Avengers see play because they are troops. Crimson Hunters are relatively new, and it wasn’t until pretty recently the Shining Spears were considered good—vasFirst of all, for every single competitive game, there will *always* be better and best things you can choose to do. For competitive lists, we are looking for the best. Not okay, not good enough, the best; which means at any given time the majority of a codex will not be in conention  for those slots. 

40k is a game about point efficiency. There wYeah. That’s definitely true. We’ll have some competitive options, unfortunately most of the range will probably be priced out. We’ll see how the meta develops. 

I almost think Eldar, and really every other army? need a rework from GW. The Primaris are the new benchmarks that we compare our models and weapons to. 

The metagame  math-hammer is no That doesn’t include the cost of their lances though. If you factor that in, it’s only a 20% increase. Which is okay. Not good, but okay. 


Most models have been in the 10-20 range. I think the SM intercessors should be viewed as the benchmark for the rest of the game and they had an increase of 18%. 

Shining Spears going up 2% more is okay, it’sThe people on eBay are fully allowed to do everything that they are doing.

This is a private and consensual transaction between two individuals.  This is totally fine and normal.

A person has an item they want to sell and ask a starting price for it. Potential buyers can determine if they want to pay that price or not.

It is that simple.

There I know his bullshit is super popular on Reddit, but it’s stupid as all fuck. It **really** is. It’s so braindead.

Do you want more devs on your game to make it bigger and better? The game needs to make money. 

There is *nothing* wrong with these mounts. It is totally up to each person on whether it is worth it to them. 

Lots of players will playYep. I think at this point we should just expect to see it. 

Looks like enough people have been sticking to the 6 month plan that it’s been successful for Blizz and, there is nothing wrong with that. 

There are lots of people who will play the full time or close to the full time and getting the mount is just a bonus added on top of an already redOne of the other issues that Preach has noted is that it’s impossible to balance fights when there is that much fluctuation in character power. 

There is a good chance that the fights end up way too easy for the people that know the right covenant/soulbinds and/or incredibly hard for the players who don’t. 

That’s not even to mention the differenYeah. It’s an overly complicated mess. 

Their idea going in was that if they make it as big as possible, they would have more tuning knobs to get everything balanced out. 

Well...so far in the Alpha, this has not only *not* been the case, but it’s actually doing the opposite and causing the issue to url the Allcraft episode, Preach mentioned diffThat’s the big thing. The WoW community, for the most part, is very much about min-maxing. 

The only people who are not impacted are the most casual of casual who mostly just do things solo. Anyone who raids, M+ or PvP is impacted by the min-max culture around the game. People want to be successful at whichever content they choose and want to grou&gt;...he clearly wanted to live since he hasn't killed himself before this...

I also have bipolar and I just want to point out that this isn’t necessarily true. 

I’m not suicidal, but I definitely don’t want to live. 

I do the best that I can each day, but I also hope each day is my last. That something happens in the night and I don’t wake up Okay look at primitive and prehistoric societies. They depended on knowing cycles of the moon for hunting, they needed to know how to plan for the seasons. It was all in reading the stars. 

If you go out in a part of the planet far away from civilization, at night, all you’ll have is the moon and the stars. 

Monuments and tombs built in accordanc&gt;Your advice to me to chill out and enjoy this "pointless" game as you put it was to play silly fluffy games, to downgrade myself to a newb, to give up on challenge and growth, In a Wargame. Not sunshine and farts-game, but War. Who does that to someone? Sometimes I think you gave up on the Eldar some time ago and although you may have collectedI mean this with no condescension, nor dismissal, nor derision, only from a place of empathy relating from similar experience of Bipolar disorder...are you having an episode right now? 

I ask because I know some of my manic episodes have expressed themselves in a similar fashion over the years. When I was younger I didn’t immediately recognize the&gt;Who is the negative nancy now?

you.

This giant non-stop rant of self-indulgence  harping over a pointless game is indicative of it all. 

All I’ve done is try to help you to chill out and enjoy the game. 

Also, Bipolar is Hell. I would never wish it upon anyone. It is an illness that kills. 

I find my ways to deal with it and it’s definitelI disagree. 

I think the stars are intrinsically tied to nature and the celestial theme is fitting of a Druid. 

Honestly, I think part of why people don’t associate them is because they have so far removed from nature and the stars themselves. If you grow up in the city or suburbs, you don’t see the star, you don’t follow the changes in the moon.Priest is more of an umbrella term for a wide array of different priests from different cultures. A troll priest is different from a Night Elf priest, which is different from an undead priest, etc. They were not unified under a singular order like how Paladins were. They have different faiths and beliefs and this was further represented by each racI don’t. I actually really like the sun and moon focus for the DPS spells of the spec. 

My only request is that I would like to have more of our old plant and wind utility spells back and baseline. Fortunately, we are getting some of them back, and if we choose to go Maldraxxus, we can also get an updated version of insect swarm. 

To answer the tTo be fair, they use both nature and arcane. All of the sun related spells do nature damage. It’s not like it’s only Arcane. 


Furthermore, we still have access to plant based spells like entangling roots and summoning treants. We also have access to wind based spells such as typhoon and cyclone. 

I’m Shadowlands, we sort of get insect swarm backThat’s the opposite of what you said last time. 
 Hmm a typical smarmy and stupid response indicative of a smug lefty lol.    

Also, *of course* you’re going to be here all night. You’re just a smug lefty. It’s not like you work or  do anything productive. Just sit on social media and complain or deliver the same rote quips day in and day out. 

IAll you’re doing is complaining. A lot of it is really stupid shit too. 

You just want people to agree with you. Eldar bad. GE bad. 

I’m sorry, I’m not going to be another person to simply agree with you and I think it’s unhealthy for your mental state to rant so much about minor grievances.

 Let it go. Make some jokes. Whatever. It’s not worth LMAO

I never even said a damned thing about karma mattering. I couldn’t care less about my own karma.  I was just using it as a way to illustrate that people disagree with your bullshit. It’s bullshit, mate.

I can attempt to teach you something, fully aware of what kind of person you are OR I could spend it doing something productive or entertainSo, the important thing to remember with any competitive game is that there will always be better and best options. 

The other thing to remember is that 40k is a numbers game. How can you most efficiently use your points? What is the effective killing power for every unit you add? There can be other things to consider as well, like support units tBro, I was trying to give you advice on how to enjoy the hobby and life in general. 

The other reason why is because I want to show the positives of Eldar and try to make you and anyone else reading it feel better and more confident in their army and collection. 


Take it or leave it, I don’t give a fuck. You’re your own person in charge of your Hmmm...


Well, if lefty ideologues want to try to remove people they don’t like, people should start putting the same pressure back on them. 

If Chap started to harm advertiser relations, then clearly the rest can be susceptible. It just takes enough people complaining about it through social media, emails, phone calls, whatever. Just fight fire I think the biggest issues they ran into were the jumping and mounting animations rather than the armor. 

I think there are ways to overcome it if they want it to; it was more a matter of choosing whether  to devote resources to it while time was short during the initial creation of the game. 

Personally, I think it would be cool for Naga and JinOf course it is. My point is to don’t act like Eldar are the only ones that get nerfed. Every body does. What’s OP now has no guarantee that it will remain so. 

I’ve been with the hobby long enough to know that eventually everything that over performs will be nerfed. The game is constantly in flux and has phases in which various units, armies or s&gt;I do believe your calling me a newb.

Not even in the slightest. I have a massive collection I’ve been building over 20 years. Why would I ever want to limit myself down to a tiny portion of it? I want the hobby to be fun, and it’s fun to not spam the OP units and play lower power fluffy games with other like minded gamers.
