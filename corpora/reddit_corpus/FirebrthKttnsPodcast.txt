Basically it means that you describe the situation, and whatever solution they try to come up with, you can use improv to help describe how that happens. Describe the forest, the camp, and their surroundings. Then wait and see how they react.  They're goinHere is a video of how the app works:  [url](url[0]=AT2In groups. Usually about 2 to 6 people are the "party of adventurers" and one person is the "dungeon master" who plans out the dungeon and rolls for the enemies and the people the party encounters. Every game is different for each group, yes, depending on the choices they make. The plots can range from horror like the Firebreathing Kittens adventurD&amp;D is like if you and your friends were in a movie acting your way though it. Your choices determine where you go, who you talk to, and how the plot ends. I've also heard it described as storytelling chess. Or think of yourself walking down a road, figuratively. You might turn left or right at an intersection in the plot; that's up to you.

There are also true crime podcasts.  An example of a good interesting one is The Accused.

Actual play Dungeons and Dragons podcasts are also free.  One example is the Firebreathing KittensFrom my experience editing our podcast, I do two types of editing:

1. **Sound editing.**  This involves me removing background (global edit), compressing the tracks so they are of uniform volume (global edit), truncating silences (a global edit), and silencing individual sniffles, coughs, and lip smacks (point edits).  The global edits are quite eIf you're looking for a two to three hour story, you're welcome to listen to the Firebreathing Kittens podcast.

It's a bit more storytelling focused than other podcasts because each episode gets an ending, one way or another. For example if it's a mystery maybe the party figures it out and, for example, stops the killer, but sometimes theyGhost writers usually don't get their name on the cover or royalties from the book's sales.  They also often have to follow the instructions they receive and have limited creative freedom. This is a bit different. The author's name goes on the cover and they get royalties from the book's sales.  The author starts with a story that is already 20,000Each adventure has built in editors.  The players and the dungeon master and the podcast editor are very invested in their characters and the adventure they went on.  They all read the story and offer feedback and suggestions.  That's four pairs of eyes on every story before it gets published.

The editing process looks a bit like this:
