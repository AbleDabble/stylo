It's a terrible deal for the Jets when you consider that Adams was the 6th pick of the 2017 draft, that 6th pick could have been Mahomes at #10 or Watson at #12 plus some trade down capital, and they're getting back mid-20s picks that they are only getting to use 3 and 4 years after they drafted Adams.  The Jets sucked really bad to get that 6th piManish was the one who broke the story, and I bet he was sitting on it during his appearance Wednesday.   The link to his story is in the url report.  
One thing the url left out (no surprise!) is that the reason the GM didn't put an offer on the table was because the owners lowered the team budget!  
So now Dan gets to root for a team whose owner They say they're going to lean into the betting angle and now's the time to do it, but, meh.  
I kinda got sick of Shek's act so I hope he changes things up on the new gig, but kinda doubt he will.  
I hope he stays away from leaning on ex-athletes to carry the show, it wasn't working.  
I'm not sure I see much improvement in chemistry with Shek anIn general you are right, but Bill describes himself as someone who started out as a twenty something bartender with nothing who wrote columns for his own web site and started The Ringer to try to resonate with a younger and more diverse demographic than ESPN draws so you would think he'd be a bit more thick skinned than he seems to be coming acrosI think the "Snark Industrial Complex" is down on Lombardi because he blasted Doug Peterson's qualifications to be a head coach, then a few months later Peterson took Philly to a Super Bowl win.  
Thing is, no one can be 100% right, yet so many people pile on when you say something that ends up wrong, most media types won't say what's on their mindBack when Reggie White was great, there was another player named Reggie White.  He frequently was referred to as "The Other Reggie White".  He played for my favorite team for a while.  Every time his name got called during a game I mentally inserted "The Other" in front of his name, lest my hopes be raised that "The Great Reggie White" was somehow I'm not sure I understand Chris's hot take on GreGG's piece.  He seems to be saying do everything to get the generational talent at QB and keep trying till you do, but that doesn't necessarily work out.  For instance, GB has Rogers but not much else.  GreGG seems to be saying you have to get both the right player and the right economics to be able I guess if you look at it this way it's right, but do people go visit those sites directly or do they see click bait pop up in their twitter feeds and just read a few lines and leave?  I listen to the Bill Simmons podcast and he and his 70 year old dad talk about articles he reads in The Boston Globe, but I doubt few people still read old school stI suppose I need to stop being such a cheap bastard and spend a few bucks and see if reading The Athletic can rekindle my interest in reading sports news articles.  Lord knows reading my local media outlets is a waste of time. These once proud titles are now filled with jackass writers doing shitty hot take articles, basically sports talk radio in I think this is a good take.  When I was a teenager I would eat up all the content. Now when I read it has to be worth the time.  I love Wes's and Marc's long form articles.   Can't say I remember Gregg or Dan doing any deep dives.  These days I'm consuming content while on the move.  The podcast fits in well with that.  url or the NFL app don't seTFA says: 
&gt; La Croix was essentially an experiment in hipster design. It had an aesthetic that appealed to large masses of people who believed they were part of a fringe group. They didn’t care that the drink wasn’t that good. They liked that they had an interesting preference.

&gt; Meanwhile, there have always been better alternatives. ICounter point: Establishing a culture really matters.  We humans are tribal, and we take on the characteristics of our leaders more than we seem to realize.  I realize it because the CEO and CTO of the company I work for are assholes, and the entire management chain are also assholes, mainly because they reflect the behavior of the assholes above t"3Gs" has the inevitable [winners and losers](url) write up for you.  
Hint: A big winner is "Mr. Big Chest", and he's not talking about The Loose Cannon.  
Believe it or not, he ends with a bit of a whine:  
&gt; Couldn't the Steelers have waited until free agency coverage started Sunday? The Brown trade -- coming after reports of deals for Michae+1 for Edelman.  The other Pats receivers (Hogan, Patterson, Dorsett) were invisible.  Brady's life would be so much more manageable if the Pats ended up signing Cooks instead of trading him to the Rams for a 1st round pick that ended up being an injured offensive lineman.  On the other hand, the Rams lives aren't going to be very manageable going Sure, the coach matters, but so does the player.  
To pick a few examples out of my early morning no caffeine brain:  
1) Mark Sanchez is just too dumb to ever learn what Bellichick is teaching  
2) Ryan Fitzpatrick has long runs where he can stay in the zone but then a switch flips and he throws the dumbest of interceptions, usually when pressure What's so great about the new school pass heavy offense we saw KC use?  Sure, a few really cool plays but lots of misfires too.  Game drags on because little clock is used per play.  WRs can't be hit so the refs let all kinds of hand checking go on, the game becomes more about what fouls the refs call vs ignore.  New England's offense just flows.  As usual, you got it just right, especially when you say the reader needs to bring a discerning mindset to the table.  Unfortunately so many approach sports from an overly emotional angle.  One reason I love the podcast so much is you guys partake of the emotional aspects of fandom but don't let it dominate.  It manages to avoid  homerism while keeJust look at INT play.  Ben went to the line not knowing if he'd be doing a fake or real spike.  He had to something to alert the hot receiver (audible or hand signal).  The one receiver went out but three Patriots went out in coverage and a fourth was naturally playing center field.  Ben didn't recognize the mismatch, he just forced the throw in. I guess that's an individual decision.  From my point of view, we all chose not to speak out about a lot of things.  Favoritism.  Nationalism.  Racism.  Nepotism.  Cronyism.  Ageism.  Inequity.  Add sexism to the list.  We all try to size up what we can do something about and what we cannot.  We all try to work within the system and if the pain is On the GM Street podcast, Mike Lombardi said  
&gt; In New England, you’re not allowed to extend -- like, you can’t extend the ball in New England. That’s a rule.  If you do it, you’re not going to play. You’re not going to go to the pylon ... the reason is, not because you think you’re going to lose control of the ball, (rather) because the ball gIt's not all about the bottom line, it's also about the quality of the product, and it's hard to achieve that if you're always churning the organization.  All the upper level bosses see is butts in seats at a low cost and they're so proud of themselves.  They don't see how stressed out the few people holding it all together really are, and how the Thing is, we all learn not to speak out too much about the team we're on or we know we'll get the arse.  Same was true of every generation that's proceeded us.  That doesn't mean we should tolerate sexism in the workplace, it just means we have to find a way to fix it within the personal or group dynamic, or move on.  It's sad if it comes to movingI started my career as an intern, which is another form of seasonal worker due to school schedules.

Podcast listeners, I defy you to read this to yourself in anyone other than Marc's voice!  
Lots of classically sublime Sesslerisms in this piece.  
Totally filled with the vibe that defines The Quiet Storm.  
I highly recommend giving it a read.  
Who cares if it's meters/yards/whatever down on the url site?  
It's our Marc and we'll read anythingGood call.  Not only were the scenarios being proposed preposterous, but they nailed the silly mannerisms and the 'music on hold' matched the personality of the various GMs.  I think the first one was in the era where the shadowy league figures didn't clamp down on their use of music.  All in all, they nailed it.  The follow-ons were enjoyable but Personally, I doubt Rex will be back in the NFL.  He cashed in with the J-E-T-E and again with BUF.  I think a cushy media gig will be all he needs to get his football jones cured.  
Besides, as Marc said, he did suck his last few seasons.  His schemes didn't work and his players did not play with discipline.  He earned his firing.  At least he wasESPN Football Today was also my go-to pod back a few years ago, but in the Florez/MDub era.  Stumbled into Shek and listened to it for a while but got sick of his overbearing personality.

As for ESPN, still listen to Barnwell on occasioLabas!  It would be interesting if this sub would act as a comments section for articles/podcasts, like why Smart Guy Nathan Hubbard really missed the point on why geezers like me spend big bucks to see the ageing performers/bands of our youth on tour.

I know it's ancient history for a lot of people, but if you were doing the 1993 Pain Rankings the Pats would rank higher than Thanks for the update, Chris!  We're all very thankful that the chemo and radiation treatments are over.  We're also thankful that you are on the show as often as you are, given the challenges you are working through.  I appreciated your push-back on the Pain Rankings segment on yesterday's pod.  CLE still seems like it's got the worst of it, and iImpressive list!  I think the Jets one needs a refresh.  It of course should be a jet crashing, not a car.  If not that, given this is their relegation season, it should be 'Yackety Sax', the Benny Hill theme song (or the closest thing to it in the NFL's free music database).  It works as the perfect accompaniment to the one play most people think Flagging every instance?  A lot was still allowed last year.  Here's a list of last year's guidelines of what is allowable, don't see why we have to go beyond them: (1) dancing that is not sexually suggestive; (2) celebrations with teammates that are not choreographed; (3) spiking the ball, as long as it’s not directed at an opponent; (4) spinning La Syd is #1 in my book, and I go back to the days of Gold Standard.  Syd has the best ever timing at the drops, and is great at producing them, and she sings too.  Doubt we've heard TD or GS offer up their singing voices.  What I mainly remember is them offering up that football wasn't their favorite sport.  Syd was a great counter balance to the I see your point (and did two paid internships myself back in the day which were great for gaining experience, but they were pre-graduation so IMHO less exploitative) but IIRC this is the end of her third one and it seems the NFL has hordes of college graduates on these 7 months on, 5 months off gigs.  
Later in the show Dan teased the idea that SyI listened to the segment and didn't hear anything that would make me think otherwise.  Clearly she's not happy about it, and Dan seemed to unintentionally cut her off from expressing even more of her unhappiness.  If it were for more nefarious reasons I don't think she'd be given a chance to say goodbye on the air, so I'm going with the usual NFL Shadowy?  It sounds to me like the same old NFL sabbatical screw job: the NFL is too cheap to pay Sydney a professional wage and give her benefits.  It's a real shame, since she is so talented in so many ways.  Hopefully for us she can be back in time for the NFL season.  Hopefully for her she can latch on to a better job and find her way out of giNope, Brady's incredible competitive need to win will drive him to banish the Madden Curse for all time, just like the 2004 Red Sox banished the Curse of the Bambino for all time.

The proportional approach is fair, not fiscally burdensome for our very underpaid crew, and also having one nice sandwich meal per GGML round would make for a nice event for the podcast too!  It never made sense to me that a long losing streak would mean buying countless sandwiches for the others, and in practice it led to the debt beinDoing a quick scan of Dan's work we see stories about:  
* Odell Beckham's tatoo
* AJ McCarron's restaurant
* Tom Brady's jersey
* Tony Romo in an NBA uni
* Patriots banners
* Aaron Rodger's relationship ending
* Lots of other schlocky stories  
Seriously wondering if this is a good look for you, Dan.  I know times are changing and a show about notI guess I hear it differently.  Dan literally led with "The Steelers lost Le'vion Bell early in this game, but that is not the story here, the Pats were by far the superior team".  Yes, he said the Pats were superior, but he led with the injury narrative.  I know losing Bell was big, but the Pats won the game that Gronk got injured in.  
Dan also fLots of credit to /u/chriswessling for praising Belichick as the best team builder in the NFL.  He said that it's not about the best 53 but it's about the right 53.  But even that falls short, because I don't think there is a better roster 1 to 53 in the NFL.  That means the average Patriot is better than the average player on every other team.  ErHard to defend Chris Hogan when some combination of Edelman, Amendola, Mitchell, Bennett, White and Lewis are also out there for the GOAT to throw to.  All can catch.  Heck even James Devlin can catch.  
Hard to do man coverage when most of your men can't cover these players one on one.  It was a given going into this game that Brady was gonna shreI guess /u/chriswesseling is a Pats fan too, because:  
&gt; 3. As much credit as Belichick receives as the game's most brilliant strategist, he also has the equivalent of a **doctoral degree in team building**. He knows it's not the best 53 players, but the right 53. After watching Hogan go underutilized in Miami and Buffalo, the Patriots' braintrI think Dan did go over the top at points, but overall, I get it, it's a bit, but of course "there's truth in jest" too.  Now, he reaps what he sows.  
And yes, every team cheats, and the NFL did not catch Tom Brady doing anything, but they suspended him anyway.  
I'm more bothered by the lack of understanding that with the Patriots it's not about Hanzus already posted on Twitter that Julio Jones and Chris Hogan had identical stats in their championship games.  Chris Freaking Hogan.  
Most of the national NFL media has a hard time predicting the Patriots games because there is no Julio Jones to focus on.  
Love the podcast, but was really annoyed at hearing the doubts the Heros had about theI thought I'd post this because The Heros are (transplanted) Los Angelenos and we have a few here as well, and I wanted to know if this article's biting takes are on target or not.  Here's one spicy quote:

The link I posted above shows how a lot of this is about the Chargers not dragging Loved the interview with Marc.  Nice hearing him 1:1 instead of mixed in with the other Heros.  Great to hear an Earnest Byner reference too.  Kind of surprised you and/or Marc didn't work in a reference to the fact that last week's playoff games had the biggest point difference since 1982.  That's a thing, you know.  Also kind of surprised that MaHaving listened to many different podcasts, unfortunately the main metric with standing in the podcast industry is the iTunes rating.

Dan's gleeful reporting of Gronkowski's injury is pretty low class, IMHO.  He and the Jets deserve eachIMHO Dan came up short on his reporting.  No hot takes.  No onions were hung.  Why not ask the security guard why it is necessary to see a badge on a guy she's known for years?  Why does the badge have to be around the neck?  I too hate having things around my neck.

One rule of the Team of ATN is not to pick a front-runner, which leaves PIT and NEP off right away.

ATL might have had a shot but they have a history of After reading [The Belichick Letters](url) and listening to Marc describe it on the previous podcast, his angst about the Browns performance on Sunday (and their situation in general) is so much easier to understand.

If the Broncos slid into the playoffs last year, what about the two weak losing efforts NE had versus the (bad) Eagles and the (bad) Jets that could have secured them home field advantage and quite possibly the trip to the Super Bowl (given how close the playoff game ended up being)?
