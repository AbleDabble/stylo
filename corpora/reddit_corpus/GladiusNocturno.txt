Yeah, I posted it a while ago with...mixed response, haha.

An argument I saw a lot was that, as it is, we just have to assume Robyn is trustworthy and that if the heroes did any research on her, it was off-screen and doesn't matter because the narrative already tells us that she is trustworthy.

I just feel it would have been better to see more ofBlushing is one thing, but her expression is not of embarrassment, she also didn't have to go with him to the dance, but she did because she wanted to.

As for Jaune's terrible traits, I'm talking about his self-centered nature which is precisely what he grew out of in the dance arc. This idea that it's about his place as a leader, his pride, and h1 episode between the introduction of the Happy Huntresses and the Election.

I had the idea for an episode in which Blake and Nora had to team up on a mission that had them explore the poorest areas of Mantle looking for a Grimm bridge, in it they end up teaming up with the Happy Huntresses, getting to know Robyn and the rest of the team and seeinSome schools make you grow beans in a glass jar, combat schools make you design and build your own weapon using their resources and I assume teacher guidance.

This is something combat schools do, but I'm not sure if every character that did go to a combat school also made their own weapons. As far as I know, only Ruby, Qrow, and Velvet explicitly If we are going to be fair here. Blake did show feelings for Sun. It's just that those feelings went from a crush to just friends later on and the nice guy trope was subverted in canon because Sun genuinely just wanted to help Blake and didn't get the girl.

The nice guy trope basically boils down to the girl realizing she shouldn't have rejected tPeople hate white knight because of the stereotypes it brings and because it's a trope many consider toxic.

I personally don't is as bad as people make it out to be and I dont agree with plenty of people who either ignore the evolution of their relationship, or simply think it doesn't matter how much it evolves, it's still a "nice guy" getting theAll of that is explained later. If you want spoilers, here it goes.

url isn't respected as the absolute hero. She is respected because she took over her father's role as the leader of the Red Dragon Knights.

url is in a sort of magic coma after infusing himself with the power of all other crimson crestbarers. The Avatar of the dream primordial heEven then it's weird, why would he lose the key? and wouldn't losing the key be a good thing? The key is the maiden's magic which is tied to their aura which in theory would become a part of his aura, but let's say he does lose the key...the relics cant be collected, period, thus the gods cant come back and there is no risk of them destroying the wThat's possible. Her official rank is still a special agent which I believe is the same rank Cordoven has. But since we just don't know anyone else in the chain of command in the Atlas military, she is still the best choice story-wise to assume the role even if it's in the future and not right now.

Honestly, this basically makes me wonder who woulRuby: How dare you?!

Pyrrha: It's the truth, sweetie, right Jaune?

Jaune: I..

Ruby: Jaune thinks I'M the best girl! Right Jaune?!

Jaune: You know....

Pyrrha: Huh! Clearly he thinks I AM THE BEST GIRL!

Jaune: Guys, there is no need to..

Ruby: Which is it?!

Pyrrha: Yeah! Tell us Jaune!

Ruby and Pyrrha: TELL HER IM THE BEST GIRL!

Jaune: REN!I actually think this is how it's going to be. After Ironwood dies (and we all know he will whether we like it or not), and with Clover dead, Winter is the most likely character to become the General of the Atlas military. I wonder if she would become the headmistress of Atlas Academy or if the council will know better than give two seats to the miBut they were still there regardless of meta reasons. They were included so that Penny could kick their asses, but Glynda does points out that you have to qualify to enter the tournament and since CRDL did, it means they were skilled enough even if barely. Hell, they actually won the first round, the 4v4 match because the match with Penny was a 2v2The thing is that that's the ceiling of Jaune's speculated level. We really don't know if he beat Flynt alone or not so saying he is stronger than Flynt isn't accurate. Saying he is at best stronger than Flynt at his strongest is the best way of viewing it, but we still don't know for sure until Jaune gets a proper on screen fight that isn't glorifI'll say they are average.

The comic pretty much shows that CRDL gets away with being bullies because everyone else think they are pathetic and don't care to do something about it.

Velvet is actually stronger and more experienced than Cardin, the reason she doesn't kick his ass is because she approaches faunus discrimination passively and non conThank you so much. Not gonna lie, I was hoping you in particular saw this, I wanted your views but didn't know how or if I should ask you directly.I really appreciate you took the time to answer.

I see, so it would essentially be a matter of personality and context in the first scene. In order for it to play out like I made it, Ilia would still haYou see, my problem with this line of thinking (and Ive seen it a lot)it's that it sounds like people saw Jaune in volume 1 and zoned out every single scene involving him in the rest of the show.

Yes, majority of Pyrrha's character revolved around Jaune, but that doesn't mean we didn't get to see her own character struggles that didn't have anythiIn all fairness, Yang and Neo's only interactions in the entire show involves Neo beating the shit out of her and Baked Alaska some how is super popular.

Arc's Furnace involves Cinder murdering Jaune's almost girlfriend, impaling his former crush and wanting to kill his female best friend and I sure as hell enjoy me some yandere Cinder shenanigansShe did have specifically mom problems, she had problems with both of her parents. Their relationship was hurt by their opposite views on Sienna's White Fang, to the point Blake was convinced her father leaving the Fang was something to be ashamed of (or at least Adam convinced her of that going by the Adam short).

She thought her parents hated heGoing only by those parameters I'll say Volume 6 is the strongest. It's a character focused story with a lot of character development and great animation.

Volume 7 is great but the character growth for the most part isn't about the main characters aside for Oscar and Qrow, so going by your parameters, it's not the strongest.

The weakest by those Not much happened this week. It's my sister's birthday today and as a gift, I decided to teach myself how to make jewelry so that I could fix her favorite gold necklace, she had been really boomed out for months for breaking it and not being any jeweler open due to the pandemic. 

Also, for some reason, twice today I got to talk about Sun and real-Nothing. Finn's mom gave birth while Rody and his team were traveling back from a mission. He received a letter from her saying that it was a boy and that she wanted Rody to name him and he asked the team for opinions. Druke wanted a brave name, Callen wanted a scholarly name, Alira wanted a charming name but Yuki said that she didn't think a kid sApes with a magic mutation.

The tail is the main difference between monkeys and apes but there are others. Monkeys are smaller and have smaller and less developed brains; their skeletons are more similar to quadruped animals than Apes' skeletons; Apes have an appendix while Monkeys don't; Apes are smarter than Monkeys; and finally, Apes have largeOh, sorry, should have clarified that's my theory.

Because of the prehensile tail, he would have to be a spidermonkey, a howler monkey, or a wooly monkey. His tail is thin and he can't scream louder than normal so he would have to be a spidermonkey of which the Ornate Geoffrey's Spider monkey is the one subspecies that is primarily blonde, most otThis is a theory I always liked, the idea that the night vision trait is based on the animal the faunus has traits from and those faunus without night vision have other traits from their animal. For instance, Blake is a cat so of course, she has night vision, and because of the length of her ears Velvet is actually a hare, not a rabbit, meaning thaI've been trying to figure it out. First of all, poison is out of the question, every time poison deals damage she gets a charge so between you applying poison and her getting 3 charges you only have 1 change to deal damage and she will kill everyone and remove the poison from herself. This is one I think poison skin is a disadvantage.

burning migA few months ago, I wrote a One-Shot called [Guardian Angel](url) which is centered around the children of teams RWBY and JNPR as little kids. Just for fun, I decided to make a profile of one of them once they get into Beacon. The profile has spoilers for the One-Shot so I'll advise you to read it first but that's up to you. Here I go.

**Angela Ro1. It's shipping. The fun is to imagine the characters in a romantic scenario.
2. The chemistry comes from the canon evolution of their relationship, from hating each other to loving each other and everything in the middle. Romantic or not is clear Ruby and Weiss love each other.
3. Yes, they are a family, that doesn't mean they cant develop romantI have no idea if Pumpkin Pete still has the right to her image. But I doubt they'll keep using her in their boxes, not just out of respect but because having her in the boxes hurts the image of a happy family meal and the Pumpkin Pete Rabbit is already the mascot and a cartoon, so it's better marketing to replace her.

There is also this company cI would say that Blake would have still left out of guilt for the White Fang attack but Yang would have been the one follow her to Menagerie. Since Sun was the one who saw her leave, it's likely the two would have gone and not just one of them.

It's possible too that Yang wouldn't have followed Blake because she would still be hurt by her leaving,I don't remember if she stayed with the other participants of the Vytal Tournament to fight the Grimm, but if she didn't is likely she survived by being of the students that evacuated.

Yssa still works at RT and loves RWBY, I was disappointed Ciel didn't have a cameo in V7 but she might in V8...if Ciel is still alive.

It's possible she had a cameTo be fair, the only characters Ruby has had disagreements with have been Weiss and Qrow, both of which stopped once they had their character developed. Everyone else either agree with her or don't fight her so it's not a unique thing with Oscar.

As for Ruby commenting on his appearance, so did Nora and she was more explicit. However, Oscar did shIn volumes 5 and 6, to me, it felt like a little brother that admired his big sister. Oscar showed signs of interest in Ruby but he mostly looked up to her and she, in turn, was quick to give him support when he needed it.

Come in volume 7 and at the beginning, they kept that dynamic, Oscar had worries and went to Ruby to talk about them, it all fRen and Jaune's V7 outfits. I agree with you, the only thing that doesn't work for Jaune is the haircut but the outfit itself is awesome. As for Ren I still believe he got the best new look in all of V7.

Nora, Ill go with her V4-6 look. I think it worked better than her current which I wish had been more wintery.

Of course, nothing beats pajama NIt's not so similar to that Railgun, the character there has full on electric powers and her railguns are based on scientific principles.

Yours is more fantasy oriented which works for RWBY. What you have here is an ability that works like a railgun but technically isn't.

I like the concept, you can use any object but need to charge it up like a I've always liked the idea of Jaune getting the offer of getting Pyrrha back, but I personally prefer it if by the end of things he rejects the offer.

Before the Dawn killed any chance for me to believe Salem would be interested in Jaune's aura and semblance though (not going to spoil why just read the book or the mega thread).

Salem shouldn't beIm not sure. Networking works on emotions and sensations, but transmitting aura through it is another thing.

It sounds less like something he could do and more like another ability networking allows, meaning that anyone could do it if networked but extending aura requires training and not everyone would automatically know they can use networking lDistance is limited by how much aura the user has and training to extend it.

There is a way to use a semblance on something the other side of the world, if the user infuses their semblance in a person or object and their semblance allows it, they can have an effect at long distance. That's how Raven's semblance works, she bonds with a person  infuYeah I agree. 

There are other ways to explore distrust with Yang beyond having her having a falling out with Ruby. Not that it can't happen and I think it can be interesting, but it's not necessarily what will happen.

I also wonder just how much focus Yang will get this volume. V7 didn't give her much so I thought that maybe V8 wasn't going to gThis one is kind of weak especially compared to the other forms of telekinesis we have seen.

Glynda's telekinesis allows her to control anything and heavier objects cost more aura.

Carmine's telekinesis allows her to control small objects but in big quantities, she can't control large objects or she finds it really hard so she prefers to control Sounds good. It sounds great because it basically means that the user cherishes the memory of the animal companion and is able to use that impression of their aura later.  How many times can she use the same summon? Is it a thing like she tamed a cat 2 years ago and no other animal but she can keep summoning the same cat over and over, or can she o&gt; I like the Animal Friendship idea. How common are animals? 

The show doesn't show them much just because of budget reasons, but in theory, there are more animals than humans because Grimm don't attack them unless they attack first.

&gt; Are summons a common semblance? 

So far no, only the Schnees have them but that doesn't mean that only thRuby: What the fuck were you doing?!

Yang: Chill, sis! I took the boys for milkshakes.

Weiss: What?!

Blake: You got to be kidding me!

Yang: What can I say, there is the fun team and then there is...your team.

Nora: THOSE ARE MY BOIS!

Yang: They loved it! right, boys?

Jaune: I....

Ren: You know...

Oscar:....Aunt Yang is really cool.

Yang: Tai trained Yang so the general consensus is that he most likely has gauntlets too.

For semblances, the only thing we know for sure of Summer's personality is that she apparently fought by tricking the opponent into thinking she was weak just to surprise them and she also tended to base her personality around what people thought of her. What I likAnimal friendship.

All animals have aura like Zwei, what's not clear is if you have to unlock them for them but you can have a huntsman who is trained in taming animals and unlocking their aura.

I had an idea a while ago for a character based of the Pipepiper whose weapon was also a flute and their semblance let them control animals when playing In Before the Dawn it is revealed that you can't infuse a Grimm with aura because they will delete it and begin to absorb it from you. The only way for aura to influence Grimm is by covering them with it like how Marrow does it.

If you want a semblance that lets you control a Grimm, it can't be mind control because the Grimm will just delete the a&gt;That's disingenous.

No, that's majority of the reaction Ive seen, people saying it's tonal whiplash without context because they thought everything will be dark and edgy.

&gt;Yes and time had passed between the dire situation and the joke. In the teaser shit is still going down so it's more like if Ruby laughed at Jaune's hoodie while Beacon Raven is the only one who could get in time and that's in two ways, either she does feel when her bonds are in danger or the Amity Tower goes online and a messege is send worldwide. So Tai and Raven could show up, I just don't think they will.

We know Oobleck and Port tend to visit Tai, but maybe Glynda does as well, so Raven could take Glydan to But it's not shrugging though. Shrugging would have been if she didn't care about Penny which is shown to be the opposite over and over and over again. 

What you wanted was for her to cry for the robot that everyone and their mom knew was coming back anyways.

But go on ahead, call it "shrugging", im sure that's no exaggeration to boost your ego ;I really don't understand the confusion. This is after Oscar was rescued, Mantle is under attack hence why the streets are empty and the city is desolated and Yang is enjoying huntsmen work which is something she has always done.

It really feels like a lot of people thought the entire volume was going to be Jon Snow brooding. V3 ended with Pyrrha It doesn't seem like it and I don't get what's confusing for people. 

They are in Pietro's lab in Mantle then pick up the bikes and ride in a completely empty and desolated city.

It's clear this is after Oscar is rescued and while the team is going back to the rest of the group.

Mantle is still under attack but that doesn't mean they can't have Long ago in a distant land, I, Blaku, the shapeshifting catster of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil!

That was a parallel I liked in V7, how Renora had problems communicating and that was a big part of their issues while Bumblebee were able to be open with each other which lead to understanding, trust and comIm still not going to jump in and think these means meaningful interactions with odd partners and teammates though. I know they have said that's one thing they want to focus on, but there's also a lot of plot going on and I remember last year when the promo had Ren and Weiss fighting together, people wanted to see their interactions and it turned o**The Bad:**

* SSSN got the JNPR treatment. This is a big issue for me. Basically they treated CVFY like RWBY, they are the main characters and get the majority of the focus and cool fight scenes, their characters always shine and they are respected and well regarded by everyone around them. SSSN is treated like JNPR, only 1 of their members get fAlright, I finished the book and here are my thoughts:

**The good:**

* I found the story far more engaging than After the Fall. Where After the Fall's main story was very basic, Before the Dawn has a proper plot.
* I enjoyed catching up with the survivors of the Fall, I liked the role they played in the story and the hardships they faced. 
* VacuThor and Yang are naturally gifted but need to grow emotionally to reach their full potential.

Doctor Strange and Pyrrha combined great talent with study and training to reach their level.

Oscar is more like Captain Marvel. Not much struggle before getting their powers and once they did they became OP (not exactly in the case of Oscar, it takes mI never heard that complain for Pyrrha honestly and in her case, I don't see it at all. Pyrrha comes from a background of sport combat to the point she got a brand deal, she got there through a mix of lots of talent and hard work. She admires Jaune's dedication to improve himself which honestly tells me she values training and effort to grow strongI decided to make a list of the dishes I learned to cook in quarantine. Before it, I could barely make grilled chicken. Now I know how to make: Poutine, pineapple glazed pork chop, eggplant lasagna, chicken bechamel pasta, tuna sushi, beef yakisoba, paella, rib soup, onion soup, mushroom cream, Benedict eggs and a messy attempt at takoyaki....I'm gHis semblance was explained in the book "After the Fall".

The thing is that what you seem to be aiming for is a sort of hivemind. The complicated part of the semblance is the individuality lost drawback, which is also actually the most interesting part of it. On the one hand, you make the semblance very interesting for a story centered around it. It sounds like a more complex version of Fox's telepathy.

Fox is able to establish a telepathic private teamspeak by connecting multiple people's minds. He mainly does it to people he trusts but not because of the Semblance's limitation but out of a personal philosophy.  The semblance also lets him feel people's minds and it consumes so little aur
