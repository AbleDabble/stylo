After thinking about and letting the initial shock wear off, I would actually be 100% down with this fight club “underground” thing if;

A.) it was built up to and teased for a couple weeks, instead of coming out of nowhere and reeking of WWE’s latest attempt at boosting ratings for the third hour

B.) I had any faith that this was leading to sometHe didn't pin Brodie Lee, he choked him out and the referee gave him the win. The last two title defenses he's had, he hasn't tapped anyone out or pinned them. That's not really a problem but there is no way Moxley should struggle to put away MJF. If Mox only wins via DQ he's going to start looking weak, imo. Because that would mean his last three No way. Honestly, the only way out of this match is Moxley over clean with a pin. Moxley has won his last few title matches by referee decision and by forfeit. He needs a clean pinfall victory to show he is dominant. While I’d much prefer Cody to be the one to finally give MJF his first singles loss, it’s not worth pulling a screwy finish to keep hI always though a reverse (inverted?) Scorpion Death Lock would be cool. [Like this](url), minus the crossface.

For an impact finisher, I’m thinking something that starts like Shingo Takagi’s Made in Japan, but transitions into a uranage. [Something like this](url), but with that thing Shingo does where he stalls for a few seconds while he’s got hThis problem has absolutely PLAGUED the last few babyfaces champions WWE has tried to make. Becky, Kofi and Seth. They are so often pointed to as an example of WWE giving the fans what they want. The problem is, they were all built up well and they all won titles but the storylines once they became champions sucked. 

Becky for example became Seth’I agree, it was a decent 6.5-7/10. I think people forget that Dynamite is just a weekly wrestling show. The point of every episode is to be the stepping stone to the next and eventually build to the PPV. I know the cards on paper look amazing, but these aren’t PPVs. I think we judge them very harshly because Dynamite has had incredible episodes befThe Inner Circle have a few years left. I wanna see P&amp;P bring the tag team championships to The Inner Circle, and maybe Sammy hold the TNT Championship. I think The Inner Circle needs to peak in power and then start a slow decline and eventually be destroyed. It’s basically how the nWo should have been booked but instead they went forever untilWhere is this information coming from? Also why do you think Dustin would be a better booker than Kenny? I think they’d be better off singing someone like Gail Kim as a booker. I think it would be a lot better for a woman to book their women. Just me.

Also I think the women’s division is underrated and it’s in a tough place due to injuries and panI just love the idea of a hard reset on storylines by blowing up a faction and seeing where the individual members go. I can also just imagine in my mind Sammy leaving Inner Circle after he and Jericho have a falling out, leading to Elite vs. Inner Circle, with the losing faction being broken up. And Sammy makes the final pin on Jericho. That wouldI get what you’re saying, but The Inner Circle at least are very tight knit. They are always together. And like it or not, The Inner Circle has to end at some point. Otherwise it’s like the nWo which just went on years past it’s prime. I think if AEW sold this stipulation as mediatory, by order of Tony Khan, it would be believable.

But I do see whI actually figured he wasn’t fully signed. He’s done a lot to suggest he is preparing for an indie run. He got his Internet Championship redesigned, filmed a hype video himself, etc. Now they could always sign him, but as of right now I wouldn’t be shocked if they keep it per appearance.

On a related note, I kinda hope he ditches his ring gear for“Zero Fucks Friday” is the biggest joke on reddit. It’s just the one place on squredcircle where scjerkers feel safe to post their dumbass opinions without getting downvoted to hell. Ever since AEW has gotten popular it’s the same 2 or 3 posts about how Cody sucks, MJF is overrated, blah blah blah ad nauseam. Someone should make a ZFF bingo card loI’m loving him right now. I wanna see some more in ring work from him though. I’m sure he’s picking his spots due to his age and the miles he’s already put on his body. But I think his character is a very interesting twist on the “supernatural cult leader” archetype. I also think he was extremely protected in his match with Moxley. He had to be slaI agree with you in a way. I don’t think JR should be fired. But he can serve the company in other ways besides as a full time commentator. He’s been wonderful in his sit down interviews. I also wouldn’t mind seeing JR call PPVs only. But he’s a lot older now and it’s obvious his stamina and sharpness just isn’t there. Not for 2 hours a week. And hYup, I am in the same boat. I’m heavy into AEW right now but I actually fell off NXT before AEW was even a thing, around the time Adam Cole became champion. I love Adam as a wrestler, but I was invested in Gargano’s story and I was really disappointed in now he lost the title after doing nothing with it. I could feel another epically long, drawn ouThe tag title match, MJF's promo seg and the main event were great! I enjoyed Warhorse vs. Cody but it wasn't ever gonna be a show stealer. I think WH will get better with time and experience and I think it's awesome he had this opportunity. I popped huge for Cardona but I'm also a (major) mark for him. The rest was hit or miss but enjoyable.

The I don't know man, I enjoyed tonight. The biggest problems were the production issues and a few matches that didn't completely live up to the hype. It happens.

Also YEAH commentary needs to be sorted. I remember being downvoted to hell for criticizing JR months ago. Glad we're all on the same page. I don't care if he's a legend, he acts like an unpTotally agree. This the crux of Cody's character right now. He's prideful and fierce but not a bad person. He's not afraid to call it like he sees it or fight on the edge of breaking the rules. This comes into play when he wrestles other so called babyfaces because it means he can be the antogonist in the match without being a full on stereotypicalAnd even when Asuka was holding a title she still looked weak against the horsewomen. She won the SD belt because Becky and Charlotte got killed by Ronda, then she lost to Charlotte for no reason other than they needed to shoehorn her into Wrestlemania. 

Then she wins the Raw belt without actually pinning Becky. I understand why, but when she thenLucha Underground made me a fan of intergender wrestling. If done correctly it can be great. I totally get why they wouldn’t put it on Dynamite and I honestly wonder if that’s a standards and practices thing. It’s gonna be hard for a suit at TNT to look at a man powerbombing a woman and not start imagining angry tweets and petitions from advocacy gThe funny thing is, people that work in TV and film will tell you that often what is scripted and written by a writer isn’t what ends up on screen. Actors often have an enormous amount of freedom with their character, lines, delivery, etc. You’re not gonna hand Robert Downy Jr. a script and tell him “Here, say this exactly as it’s written and here’It’s a weird one. Because he’s been doing Robert Stone gimmick since before AEW, and he didn’t always look like he does now. People started saying he was a Tony Khan parody but I didn’t see it. But lately it seems like they’re getting more blatant with it.

But honestly, whatever. If it is a shot, it’s not like it’s an outright burial. Tongue in chDarby seems like Jeff Hardy in so many ways. He’s not “the guy” that you build the company around, but he’s definitely gonna be super over for his entire run in AEW and he’s probably gonna eventually win all the titles provided he stays in the company the rest of his career. I just don’t see him holding any of them for a long time, or main evening I agree for the most part. I think the indie talent should he used every now and then. After Warhorse, they’ll only used non-contracted wrestlers in the open challenge twice out of 7 times. I think that’s a decent ratio. The problem of only using AEW wrestlers is you don’t necessarily want to have Cody run through the entire roster. As much as his Wrestle Kingdom 14 (their “Wrestlemania”-like event from January of this year) would be a decent starting place I think. All of the current storylines are sorta built off what happened there. There’s also a lot of videos on NJPW’s youtube channel that can catch you up on the big storylines in New Japan. Honestly, New Japan is very easy and straightIdk, if I was running a wrestling company that catered to a more "hardcore" fanbase I would definitely check out places like squaredcircle every now and then. See what people are talking about, what is catching on, etc. A lot of companies spend lots of money trying to survey customers to find out how to market to them better. This sub is like a shiThe people defending this are jumping through so many hoops to do so. “It’s like UFC or boxing” Wrestling is worked precisely so that it can be more satisfying and tell a better story than shoot fighting where the logistics of sport and business sometimes conspire to make for disappointing realities like title vacations. Making wrestling more like Really tough call but I’ll say the feeling you get when you realize you’re watching something truly special. I got this feeling watching the tag title match at Revolution. Time slows down, and you forget yourself for a moment. Totally sucked in and engrossed by the story and the drama unfolding in front of you. You’re not thinking about booking, poYup, I can pretty much trace the moment I lost interest in NXT to Gargano's bullshit 50 something day reign. I was super invested in his story with Ciampa, and once they got the title involved it felt so obvious it was building to a Johnny title win. Now granted they needed to change plans because of Ciampa's neck problems but there was no reason tYeah, I was super hype to see Ivelisse in AEW but then I heard about all her issues. That's disappointing because I loved her in Lucha Underground. Diamante is super solid and fiery though, I'd like to see more of her. To be fair, I wouldn't mind AEW signing Ivelisse but it would be a risk. Just today I think her and Jack Evans got into it on twittI'm really not a fan personally. I feel like it makes both titles feel less important. But if you're gonna do it, do it. Find an interesting way to make it work. Honestly, having a tournament for the NA #1 contendership would have been a lot better. Then you can have a heel best Lee for the title and brag about having a win over the NXT champion. IIt’s really asinine that anyone who leaves WWE with negative experiences is hit with “You’re just bitter because you didn’t make it, don’t blame WWE”. Moxley was highly successful there and could have stayed for the rest of his career and made an amazing living, yet he left and echoed virtually everyone’s complains about the creative process and baHe just tweeted that Cody’s challenger will be “one of the top independent wrestlers in the world”. I don’t know about those Hero allegations. Never heard that he was named. I honestly wouldn’t expect it to effect their decision unless it was something really high profile and believable. A TON of people were named, and honestly not all of the allegI think it’s Cody’s challenger which will be either Chris Hero, or Eddie Kingston. Too “top independent wrestlers” as TK put it, and people I imagine Moxley would be excited to see working in his new home promotion. Now if it was Warhorse I’d be super happy, but I also think Warhorse is a given at some point. Arn wouldn’t have dropped that line if This kinda thing hits you a lot if you go back and watch PPVs and TVs from a few years ago. There have been times I’ve seen multi-man tags from only 2-3 years ago, where none of the guys are with WWE anymore. It’s kind of odd watching the awesome IC ladder match from Mania 31 and seeing half the people are with AEW now. 

I don’t know if this is trThere’s a million great talkers that never made it to the Austin or Rock level and honestly comparing people to that high of a bar feels weird to me. I think promo is important but there are a lot of people that don’t need 10/10 mic skills to be great. “But can he cut a promo?” is one of the lazy criticisms that great wrestlers are saddled with theKenny is a good talker and he has a lot of charisma. He just doesn’t cut “wrestler promos”, and that’s fine. I’ve really enjoyed his sit down interviews and backstage interviews along side Hangman. And his post-match interviews in Japan were awesome. His style is more emoting and acting than “cutting a promo”. It’s a sticking point for some people,I don’t know why people are coming at you. Martha Hart was on Talk is Jericho and Jericho pitched AEW honoring Owen in some form. She seemed receptive. Martha doesn’t hate wrestling, as is commonly thought. She hates WWE for killing her husband. She doesn’t want him in some bullshit “Hall of Fame” that is just there to sell tickets and make money oMaybe Rusev, if he doesn’t decide to quit the business. That’s really it I think. At most I think Broski might challenge Cody for the TNT title, but they will not sign him. For a few reasons, but mostly because I think AEW isn’t trying to save money and aren’t offering deals to big names right now. Also Matt has talked about how excited he is to doIt’s really weird to me seeing posts on here like “Nobody in wrestling appeals to me, I just check this sub to see what’s going on in the world of wrestling”. Like, if I didn’t care about wrestling this is the last place I’d be! I only post here because I fucking love wrestling and have nobody to talk about it with lol. And even then I resent SC a You have to keep The Elite strong. Kenny is tag champ, The Bucks are going into a high profile fued with FTR. Nobody on The Elite side could really take the fall. 

But I kind of agree with you, I want Jurassic Express to start winning soon. They are great. I think AEW’s logic is that Marko can eat pins without losing much aura, like Spike Dudley oOh yeah! 100% and I think they got a really good deal. They said it’s as good or maybe more money than they were making at WWE, and that might not even be factoring in New Japan. They’ll be fine, and they have a lot of creative freedom now too which is a plus. But it sucks hearing them express so much regret for staying with WWE.

Like you said, itI feel really bad for Gallows and Anderson after listening to that pod. They wanted to go to AEW but WWE pressured the shit out of them, and made them feel like AEW wasn’t stable and WWE would set up their families for life. They would have been millionaires if WWE honored their contracts. So they made the “smart decision”, kinda fucking over theirI mean, I’ve never once in my life been in a situation where I had to ask someone “Am I being held hostage?” lol like Gallows summed it up well, they felt tense and rumors were flying among the boys but they figured the Saudis weren’t about to murder all these stars and start WW3. But they were tense, texting loved ones, scared, they saw armed poliIt's ridiculous. Before AEW, I remember a lot of people bemoaning how we don't have any larger than life characters in wrestling anymore, and how everyone is just a guy or girl in tights who likes to wrestle. Then guys like Luchasaurus and The Dark Order come along and people complain about that too! Wrestling fans, man. But I think for every one pYes I heard Cody once mentioned him and Vikingo as guys he’d like to bring over. Not sure what happened with that. The forum post where I discovered this guy seemed to think he was AEW bound so maybe that was in an old observer or something. But yeah, hopefully next year if things calm down and travel becomes a thing again he and others from AAA caIt's not a good idea for MJF to win the AEW title right now. He's great, but he's not ready yet and honestly he shouldn't really win it until crowds are back because MJF needs that massive heel heat to hit his highest heights. Kenny Omega should be the one to take the belt from Mox. They planted that seed all the way back at DON 2019 and carried itBLOCK A

* Kota Ibushi vs. I love how FTR are making an effort to work people. They're presenting themselves as these outsiders who hate what AEW has done with tag team wrestling, even though they respect the division. It's a win win, because they;ll get heat from the fans what love AEW and they'll get respect from the old school purists that might give AEW a shot because ofQuestion since you seem pretty knowledgeable on the subject. Do you think The Cleaner character will work for an American Audience? I feel like Jericho's face painted "Painmaker" persona was perfect for Japan but his "Le Champion" character was much more suited for America. I wonder if the average fan will accept The Cleaner or if it's a little tooPeople are saying Mox is a draw. This is true of course, but AEW didn't lose those 3 weeks because of the lack of Mox. Or star power. They lost because NXT massively counter programmed them and gave away Wrestlemania weekend Takeover matches on TV. It comes down to card.

This is why NXT finds itself in a very precarious position. They've only everNice ep! Clever finish for the main event. I knew they would think of something to protect Cage in his loss. I just hope now Cage doesn’t get mad at Taz. If you really think about it, Taz did the right thing and saved Brians ass there.

Happy to have Darby Allin back! And Ivelisse next week!! As someone who binged Lucha Underground Season 1 recentlHere's a possibility I think could be cool. Cage upsets Moxley and wins the title. Darby Allin returns from injury, starts climbing the ranks. MJF starts complaining about being overlooked again and has his sights on the title. Because of MJF's record and Darby Allin's personal beef with Cage, they have a #1 contenders match that ends without a winI would love to see Myers getting some work in AEW, but I wouldn’t be a fan of this storyline. For the simple reason that Myers and Cardona don’t need to constantly be linked together in one form or another. I know that they don’t want to be a tag team anymore, but I don’t know if a singles feud between them is the best way to go. Let them go theirIt’s very funny to me that people take Cornette’s opinion even remotely seriously considering he’s been fired from every job he’s ever had in the business. Why does he have any form of aura as if he’s an authority on wrestling? The guy got famous for being really annoying and getting heat because he can talk and throw out slurs in his promos. That’Alright, I’ll take your downvotes.

Io Shirai. Don’t get me wrong, I like her. She’s very talented, without question. But I remember her being hyped up to hell and back when she first signed with WWE. People (including Meltzer) say she’s one of the best in the world, best wrestler in the company male or female, etc. She has yet to live up to the hyHe’s actually a very smart businessman who knows what gets over. His Spring Break shows have launched a few careers and helped cement his own reputation on the indies too. That and some insane deathmatches. He’s just a fun, funny character. You get it or you don’t. Cornette people hate him because fat shaming I guess. Not liking Joey isn’t a big deI don't know. My gut says that Jay is more likely to get booed just given how hated he's been for the past few years. So if they wanna keep them heel, that would probably be easier.

The problem there is you now have this need heel stable, bullet club, and suzuki-gun vs. LIJ and a Chaos that has been a non-factor for a while. Too heavy on the heel Eh, fair enough I guess. I don't think they all have to have the same background, though. And unless they want Hirmou and Wato to go for the Jr. Tags, I don't see a reason to have two Jrs. But I agree with you he would stick out, it's just a thought experiment to see what everyone thought. I'd be open to it but they would have to find a way to make100% this. I don’t really get people saying this makes no sense. Evil was always gonna be in the shadow of Sanada, then Naito. He saw an opportunity to grab power and took it. 

Plus he’s right about LIJ being rotten. It became a running gag between fans that LIJ were never there for each other. Hiromu is like the only LIJ guy that seems to give a
