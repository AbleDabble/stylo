I wish somebody would track porn preferences and compare them with political leanings, bet that would be interesting. I know somebody did a study of paying for porn per state and Utah came out on top, apparently the Mormons didn't know you can get porn for free.

How come nobody gets outed for watching porn (besides child porn)? Like I mean, hard cReuters articles tend to be fact-heavy and light on the editorializing. But honestly every news outlet will have a bias, even if it's on what to cover or not to cover, so you have to learn to read critically.

I read the NYT a lot and I'm very aware they have an elite left-leaning New Yorker bias, but they will publish falsehoods for the U.S.I knew about the underage rape allegation, how he tried not to pay contractors, allegations of mob involvement, racism against tenants, Trump university, Trump steaks, bankrupted casinos, failed football league. I'm not a New Yorker, I assume long-time NYers have heard way more. oh yeah and how his grandfather made his money off of prostitution, atoh hell yeah my mom knew somebody back in the day who worked at a clinic, where a woman could go and for any reason like missing her period, the doctors would administer a D&amp;C. Then a lot of times a fetus would come out, like oh that was an accident, we didn't know you were pregnant! This was before Roe vs. Wade. If you knew where to go and hadDamn I'm sorry that happened. Well at least you figured it out before you went any further like having kids. 26 is still young, you'll find somebody else (if you want to). I think you had a normal assumption, that your wife would put you first before her family. At least that's how it usually is in the U.S. and seems like in a lot of Western countrLady, nobody wants to go to a quiet restaurant and have a quiet meal with a shrieky baby around. Were they saying anything racist or they just didn't like the baby being noisy?

HState senators are very different from U.S. senators, it's really important to make the distinction. A U.S. senator is more powerful on the national level, of course. There's only 2 of them per state. 

Every state has lots of state senators; a few may be fairly powerful in their home states but in general the power is more diluted. State senators I live in Colorado, in a more populated area where people are conservative but you don't see a lot of Trump paraphernalia.

Here's the thing about autistic kids: you can't always leave them at home, and you can't always predict how they're going to act. Some hours or days they might be totally fine and you think you're safe going to the store, and then things suddenly go pear-shaped. And sometimes life intervenes, like there's some unBesides being something of a guild system?

These fuckin' assholes today that think porn is indicative of reality and that a mature woman should have no not really, because it's concentrated and also has to do with your social network. People in NYC know a lot of people who had it or even died from it. I live in CO, I'm an introvert with introverted friends, coworkers and biofamily, and don't know anybody who's had it. Though I expect I will pretty soon as my husband's family is conservative and noI once had a huge guy drop in on my work unannounced and act rather menacing while trying to sell his product.

Now we have Trump who is a moron compared to Dubya. The only thing I cI had an old guy steal money from me when I was a kid, and what appeared to be a 6 year old grandson was in tow (of the thief). Old guy said something harassing to me (not sure how old I was but definitely less than 14 years) as part of the distraction. Anyway,  some douchebags gonna douche, kids around or no. Sorry that guy messed up your day and For the international folks, Arizona has a huge amount of retirees, aka old people. Also tends to be conservative politically because old white people.

I'm sorry but a lot of women blame their kids instead of their partner when the partner preys on the kids - your mom has thrown you under Eh my worst bully, I'm pretty sure had an abusive household. I made an easy target. 

I also was bullied pretty badly by a black girl (I'm white) and I think she was probably getting racist shit from other kids and letting the shit roll downhill to the class leper. I was mostly in advanced classes but ended up in the hellhole of P.E. (gym class) wiI was bullied really bad, but I also bullied others on occasion. Acting in ways that I didn't seem to be in control of. Snubbing kids that were lepers like me, and being nasty to a kid I had a crush on. Definitely received way more bullying than dishing it out though.

I kind of feel bad but I was in a terrible state back then. I was depressed and Girl you should talk to him - unplug his computer in the middle of a match. If he won't talk, leave his ass and consider the $4,000 money spent on learning the lesson. He betrayed your trust and is mistreating you. He's old enough to know better.

I'm a woman and have video game addiction but have learned to try and take it easy. Real life is more it's not just anti Asian racism, apparently a lot of countryfolk think that apartment living is the same as stacked cages in a puppy mill. They've never seen a city apartment and imagine all sorts of weird things (like that your apartment doesn't have a separate bathroom). Part of the hatred of cityfolk that's developed from jealousy and ignorance.Because a significant number of Americans coast on being white Americans and have nothing else to take pride in, and Trump bolsters that. Even though ultimately the system keeps them poor and miserable.

It's similar to poor whites fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War, supporting a plantation system that hurt them (though not as badly as tIt was voter suppression in Florida, actually.

There have been epidemics throughout history and we've had outbreaks of weird diseases recently. EvenI don't know if this video is real, but I've seen a white guy asking the sole brown person in sight if they're selling drugs. It was after an event let out, very white crowd. We had a guy of Indian descent in our group. Fratboyish guy comes by just randomly asking the one brown dude for drugs, not asking anybody else (we had some hippie looking guyoh hell yeah. I've come to the conclusion that the Republican party wants a bunch of uneducated people they can control. They also want to destroy the middle class, and teachers represent a substantial part of that middle class. They dislike higher education even more and are trying to trash that too. 

Basically they want to trash any institution I'm American and it's unbelievable to me in some ways. But we have some domestic politics here like abortion and gun control; society changing: Christianity is declining, white people will no longer constitute a majority soon, homosexuality is now considered acceptable by a majority of society. Racists were upset over a black man being president. aI recently did some traveling for Reasons that weren't fun. Go through red states, hardly any masks.

He grabbed at the first thing he could think of to weaponize, your name, which is obviously a racist jab. I was the kid everyone picked on. My parents were poor and couldn't afford new clothes for me, also I have shitty hair unlike anybody in the family so I had horrible messy hair because nobody knew how to take care of it.

As I was growing and my jeanand I know somebody who was malpracticed on by a male dentist and his son. I know somebody else whose mother's cancer was misdiagnosed by a male doctor who waved it off and she ended up dying young when maybe the cancer could have been treated. What's your point? 

There are shitty doctors and dentists and it's not a male/female thing. There are shI remember reading an article about how a biracial boy (black/white) was living in a white family and it was like a bizarre open secret but they refused to talk about it and pretended his dad was his biodad (Ron Howard voice: he wasn't). It's very possible your mom had a fling or was raped or [insert any scenario you can think of] and your parents I don't personally think this is true, or at least it's not a normal state of affairs.

There are plenty of ways for high ranking politicians to make money without getting into trouble with pedophiliYou just reminded me of the time I was approached by an older white man in front of Walgreens, he had some kind of scam.

Back in the day "cunt" was basically calling a woman a vagina in a really nasty way, it was a vicious horrible putdown in the way it was said. I've also seen vicious bullying of younger boys by older boyThe kid in question seemed to be nicely dressed, so what if it's athletic?

in Colorado you're lucky if the expensive restaurant you go to on date night has people appropriately dressed upyou still need an "out" for when contraceptives fail, or circumstances change radically, or when the fetus misdevelops in such a way that it might kill the mother on the way out, and in no case will survive much past birth.

But in general, if you had all these programs in place, it would case abortions to plummet.
