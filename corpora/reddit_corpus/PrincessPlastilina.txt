I met Donald Trump like 10+ years ago at Trump Tower in NYC. He was nice to every tourist who recognized him because he loves being famous and admired. Nice means shit. I can’t believe we even thought for a second that he was cool for stopping and taking pictures with us. Eric was there too. He was very nice as well. 

Nice. Means. Shit. Some celebHe’s always been a dumbass. He quit Twitter once already because of some problematic tweets and now he’s back at it. Someone on Twitter made a thread of his worst tweets ever and he even said the n-word once, full n-word and claimed the word “gay” was equally offensive... when gay people use that word? He’s incredibly dumb. Idk why people look up tGuns, drugs, explosives? It has to be something bad. That’s the military 😳

Something about this guy, man. He’s shady as hell and he’s going to end up in prison within the next 5 years. It wouldn’t surprise me if he was a dealer or was doing something extremely illegal. He doesn’t seem to have a concept of law and order. He does whatever he wants. I know at least three people who are still hooking up with Tinder dates like nothing is happening. Some people really don’t believe this is a thing. When you ask them “are you really meeting up in person?!” They’re like “we were at a terrace!” That doesn’t matter! If you have sex with these people or you’re sitting close to each other you can stillAmerica’s stubbornness and arrogance is going to be its own demise. It makes me very sad. This whole “we’re better than everyone else, we’re the greatest country in the world, MUH RIGHTS” mentality is coming back to bite everyone. I think it’s the only country that doesn’t have a plan for anything. Not for the economy, not for schools, not for homeI would defer until this is under control, and take some online classes in the meantime. I wouldn’t pay full tuition for this mess. 

I think at this point we need to accept that many kids will have to repeat the year. The world is not prepared for this situation and nobody is coming up with a plan because they think it’ll magically go away. The saGuys I’m so mad. A close friend of mine is positive. She got sick like 90+ days ago and she’s part of the population who hasn’t gotten any better since they first got the symptoms. She still shows Covid symptoms such as dry coughing, really bad asthma attacks (Covid makes it worse), body aches, fever sometimes, she can’t smell or taste anything, bu“No one” thanks for speaking for everyone, I guess. Some people find these videos very educational. Thank God for the Internet and Youtube. Women didn’t know exactly what to expect before. Now we can learn better. There’s nothing wrong with it if you view it educationally and respectfully. Stop making every woman related thing sound so obscene. PeoI don’t get why all these prudes follow her? They get so mad when she talks about sex. Like, livid. Taylor has been making her account all about sexuality lately and some white women are not having it. They’re legit pissed. I think if it makes you uncomfortable it’s easier to just unfollow. But tone policing is a white woman’s past time apparently.Celebrities are terrified of ~cancel culture~ because they’re all questionable people with skeletons in their closet. But things are changing and many things won’t be normalized anymore, such as workplace abuse, exploitation of workers, sexual harassment, etc. If they don’t want to be criticized they better be careful and start treating people in aBecause she does what she wants and she doesn’t apologize. And I don’t care how woke some fans try to be, I know so many of them were put off by an older female lead. 

Regardless, I supported her from the beginning but I still don’t like this new development. I think she should have told them to cast Tayshia instead, not lead production on for 12 I think this is her bailing out on commitment? Almost like self sabotage because she’s putting all her expectations in one guy she barely knows and not giving herself the time to meet the rest of the guys that were recast for her. I hope this works out for her, but it’s definitely a risky move! If it doesn’t work out she can claim she tried her besThat’s how I feel. I’m not amused by this at all. I keep thinking about them flying the guys back and forth TWICE already. The first time before production halted, then recasting specifically for Clare, then quarantining everyone, sending some guys home, bringing them back... wtf Clare? The whole point of this show is that you date and get to meet You could say that, but the entire team did a lot to save this season and not catch Covid. She shouldn’t have gone on this season then. Why didn’t she quit before they began production and let Tayshia get her own full season, her own cast chosen for her, her own season. 

This was selfish. I can’t imagine production panicking trying to cast someoneI’m guessing she’s the type to not want to ~pretend, but I think that’s what your personal life is for. I hate the saying “they knew what they signed up for” but like... she knew?? You can’t just dump production like this. You had one job. This IS a job. People risked getting Covid for this. I understand not wanting to fake it, but come on, you’re I don’t know how this happened, but if Clare really quit midseason that’s extremely unprofessional of her and idk how her contract will play into this. Kaitlyn got a big paycut after spoiling her season on snapchat. Can’t imagine that Clare will get to keep her full check after this and what bugs me the most is that they were so persistent in makinWell, that was a sad post. 

But see, this is why you take care of your friendships, always. The way she treated Liz was not ok. She lets business get too much in the way of friendships and I wouldn’t doubt for a second that this was a problem with Carly too. Put influencing and podcasting aside. Be a good friend. 

I had a very similar situation wI’m guessing she was kinda problematic in a way but the show blows everything out of proportion and they took it too far. She for sure wasn’t a friendly person or a kind person. The show loves exploiting people’s character flaws and weaknesses to fit a narrative or to construct a narrative. She made herself an easy villain because she gave them as Why is there always a soft, weak ass parent who forgives everything the bad kid in the family does?! Your brother is a pervert and your mom wants to act like you should pretend it’s no big deal?? This is why there are people who do whatever they want. They never face consequences for their behavior and actions. It’s an entire life of being babied aThat’s unbelievable. I’ve never believed in bleeding myself dry for some huge company that is not mine or a celebrity that wasn’t me. Work for your own benefit, not someone else’s who’s just exploiting you. I really wish more people dumped toxic jobs where you’re expected to leave it all behind for someone else’s fortune or fame. Nope. We need to nShe actually had the nerve to call Emma Watson the worst for keeping to herself at Brown university even though her submission talked about how her nudes were being passed around campus. Now I wonder if that’s the reason why Emma took time off school and finished her degree in the UK like over a year behind 💔💔. Why would Emma want to be friends witShe really has an enormous Trumpian ego. Why can’t these people ever take responsibility for their actions and why do they assume that everyone owes them loyalty? Who’s going to feel loyal to a person who is abusive and mean? People eventually stand up for themselves and say something. Also, extremely creative? How so? Pranks are so 90’s and most oYTA.

The dress is not expensive, it doesn’t have sentimental value, it doesn’t even sound like it’s anything spectacular, your friend is very poor. Are you sure you are a true friend? I can understand being a little careful with your expensive jewelry since that does have sentimental value, but you don’t seem to be the kindest of friends and thereI’ve definitely seen so much anti-Asian racism in NYC and I’m honestly outraged. I feel for you. I promise I’ll do my best to step in whenever I see a minority being threatned in public, but especially Asians because I haven’t really seen anything similar happen to other ethnicities. I think people have this idea that Asians won’t fight back or somImportant to take in mind that this is an entirely American label, and not a label that Spaniards claim or Latin Americans either. There’s no Spanish word for Hispanic, other than the version created in America, “Hispano.” But only Americans use this term. 

Your safest bet is using everyone’s actual nationality. Some people definitely do not like Oh he leans into that Latino label *hard.* It’s what made him successful worldwide. His Spanish music was ballads, like his father’s music. When he crossed over to the US, his entire sound and look changed. They even tanned him more and his sound was entirely Latin. He wanted to be the next Ricky Martin because Ricky made it big singing in English America’s definition is nonsensical, actually. America has a very limited understanding of what race, ethnicity and nationality is. So when you fill out forms you have sometimes: “Latino or Hispanic, Hispanic White, European White.” One time I saw a form that said “White, black, Asian, indigenous, Middle Eastern.” I didn’t belong in any of those caGina Rodriguez has shown her ass so many times. I don’t understand why she doesn’t think before she speaks. She has made it clear that she’s anti-black many, many times. Dascha’s tweet came off very hostile too, along with John’s. It’s just not the way to talk about representation. It almost sounded like “why THEM and not ME.” I’m Latin and they emI’m friends with someone who is close friends with one of the actresses who accused him. This has been well known in her circle for a while and they’re all celebrating that she’s finally speaking up. My friend made a post on this hoping her friend finally gets justice. That guy has quite a reputation apparently. 

This is why I don’t like male comiThere needs to be an end to giveaways. The contests are so misleading and I’ve never seen anyone actually win shit, unless it’s a make up giveaway ran by the actual brands. Dave Lackey on social media is the only person I’ve seen who retweets every winner who has received their stuff. And it’s real people, real accounts. But his giveaways are normaHaha wow. 

I do feel for her though. It’s the kind of eccentricity and oddity that reminds me of Grey Gardens. She’s already acting and looking like a much older woman. This is the type of weird shit that women over 70 do when they live alone. But she has been through a lot of shit in just a few short years. Her break up with Jack, her hysterectomShe thinks being sick is a silly, quirky thing about her personality. Just like Jameela Jamil. It doesn’t sit well with me how much they both glamourize or add humor to having a disease when at least they can get treatment and they have good healthcare. I feel like it reaches a point when it’s really insensitive. You’re right that both sound almostEveryone says that and it’s bullshit. Celebrities and influencers are still living their lives like there’s no risk. Like you can get tested right before a party every time you want (there’s a shortage!) plus, results can take days. 

It’s clearly bullshit and people need to call out everyone harder. They not only throw parties, but they post it onGet him out of there ASAP. It’s a matter of time before he catches it and gives it to you. Not only is he putting your life at risk, but he’s being an ass about it too. If you live with someone you have to be considerate of them in every way. Like or not, it’s part of the whole roommate deal. He clearly doesn’t care about you, so don’t worry about I have a friend exactly like this and she doesn’t give a shit. She got Covid around 90 days ago. She’s one of those long Coviders. She hasn’t recovered, she has multiple symptoms still, and she hasn’t gotten tested again or gone to the doctor. She’s taking no medicine for this. She’s hoping it goes away on its own. Not only is she putting her roommPetition to have her thread back and the daily discussion on her allowed, please? I don’t see why we can’t discuss her just because she decided to make her profile private *precisely* to stop all honest conversations around her. This isn’t a private person’s profile. This is a woman who is running a shady brand and is deceiving consumers. I feel liThe whole leaving with Dale storyline seems unlikely to me though... leads sign a contract and they know they have a season to finish. Did she maybe not even get along with anyone else that she couldn’t at least try for TV’s sake?

I’m sorry but she seemed so excited before leaving. I can’t imagine her torpedoing her own season like that. She wanteThat’s exactly my thought. But in all fairness it wouldn’t surprise me if they didn’t even cast for Clare and she didn’t click with anyone for a reason. If they only cast frat guys they only have themselves blame. Fans told them they needed to recast 80% of these guys. If this turns out to be a mess due to casting, it’s the show’s fault. I doubt TaOr maybe they didn’t really cast men who would be a good fit for her. I really doubt she’s this unprofessional to just walk away when she’s been on this show many times and kept a good relationship with the show. When they don’t like you they never call you back and even Elan Gale said he was happy for this casting choice. So I don’t know if I buy I worry that they cast young douchebags who’ve been disrespectful to her or something. It’s easy to always make a woman look bad, especially one who has been labeled as crazy from day 1 just because she’s strong minded and unapologetic, but we don’t know what made her give up. If they only cast 28 year old Tyler C wannabes, I’d be frustrated too. IThat’s what they want. They want her to stop talking and to not bring politics into the show, but sorry, now more than ever people’s political beliefs say a lot about who they are. If Garrett hadn’t chosen to let his bigotry be known to the whole world, we wouldn’t even be discussing it. You can talk all day about other cast members political belieI think she has moved past the role of trying to educate bigots. Some people refuse to educate themselves. They WANT to be racists. Rachel realized a while ago that it’s not her job to come out and ask people to stop being racist. She said so herself. She’s tired of having to be the person who does that. 

But that doesn’t mean she should remain quThey won’t be. Every year we have wannabes who want to coast off on almost being cast on the show or on being there for one episode, but people never really pay them attention once the season starts getting interesting. Do you remember the Rosé Girls? Lmao. They tried to milk their one episode stint and they only embarrassed themselves. 

It’s annoI don’t think everyone can pause their lives at the drop of a hat. I think some of them were only able to do it the first time, but they can’t risk their jobs mid pandemic. I would not risk my source of income when we’re at the brink of an economic depression, all for an opportunity that may or may not bring me tons of followers. Will influencing eI don’t believe that for a minute because 1, Clare has always had a good relationship with the show and she knows how things work. She knows she’s under contract and she’s not going to pretend she can just quit mid season. Believe it or not, they all know they’re filming a TV show and they play along so much because it’s entertainment more than reaJFC, we know that. It doesn’t mean that women haven’t been called hysteric and crazy every time we get rightfully mad at something or when we accuse a man of doing something bad. Yes, black women get called angry over every little thing and every bad problem that exists has the added element of racism. But that doesn’t mean Taylor’s song is suddenlShe’s not wrong. Whoever has a problem with her choice of words, and not with Garrett’s actions, you’re definitely focusing on the wrong thing. Garrett may not have said curse words, but his words were more offensive than anything Rachel will ever say. Your fake positivity and your fake kindness is useless if you’re defending a bad person. Stop askTo talk about the cost of her expensive ring at a time like this is so tone deaf and it’s a very bad look. 

I don’t understand people who like to flaunt wealth. We’re about to hit an economic depression right now. People are dying. There’s civil unrest. Maybe don’t rub in people’s faces that you’re wealthy and carefree? Idk... this pandemic has maCall me a cynic but this whole thing is super shady to me. They’ve only known each other for a few months, that guy obviously cannot afford a ring like that so she bought her own ring and now she’s telling us how much it cost...? Ok? Idk, with her history of impulsive behavior and falling in love with someone new every 6 months, I don’t see this woHow can you work on a show that is all about positivity and kindness, and then foster this kind of work environment?? That’s the part that gets me the most. The fakery, the false pretenses, using children for a wholesome image. I know so many people who adore Ellen and their dream was being in the audience one day. She fooled everyone (and I’m refeThere were rumors about Bill Cosby for many years. The claims were out there for a while and no one cared. If it weren’t for Hannibal Buress who brought attention again to these claims on his stand up, people would’ve remained blissfully ignorant. 

She died a long time ago, but Lucille Ball was another Hollywood monster. Kinda like Ellen. Likable So ready for her show to be canned. It’s time. No better time than now. It’s become too repetitive and boring anyway. She can’t be nice to staff and guests alike, so audiences shouldn’t even be watching that phoney anymore. She doesn’t deserve the success. Go back to obscurity and remember all the years you were shunned by Hollywood. You had a big I really wish America and Canada understood that Spaniards don’t identify as Latinos. Spaniards are *not* Latinos. You may not hear them complain publicly about it because they don’t want to offend a community that loves them and supports their work since before they made it big in Hollywood, and they don’t want to be misunderstood or make it look 129 followers and 4,000+ posts though? Bitch no one cares about your posts CLEARLY. Delete the app and go read a book or something. What a waste of a life and what a horrible human being. I wish Rachel didn’t read her DMs. Just let these miserable people scream into the void alone. Those demons inside this person are eventually going to push everyoThey act like he’s pulling his pants down and mooning the flag. It’s just kneeling. And keenling is very respectful. Knights have to kneel when they’re being knighted by the Queen. You kneel when you propose. Some kneel in Church when they pray. Kneeling is a peaceful respectful form of protest. Which they all seem to ask for when people start smasI don’t share her opinions lmao. Look how far Jed went. He wasted an entire season. It’s just not ok at all. Hannah wanted to find someone, not be humiliated like that and have her season ruined. Nobody should go that far. Ali sounded silly defending Jed because I don’t think she would have appreciated if someone wasted her season. 

Anyone who hasLet her do what she wants. We don’t have to be polite to racists if we don’t want to. What he believes in puts many people in danger. The way he votes kills vulnerable people. This is a very messy time in history to be so soft. Racists have earned all the scorn in the world. Racists call people much worse names. 

We are not in kindergarten anymoreOh sit down. Since when do we have to be nice to racists. Look at the mess America is in thanks to all the people who voted for the bigot in the White House. People are dying. People are being abused by cops during marches. People are being put in unmarked vans. People are being asked to die for the economy. 
I’m tired of fake niceness and toxic po&gt; And when that all came out, we attacked it, because I feel like when I was ‘liking’ things, it was going against what she stands for, and that made it really hard on us as a couple. So when we started talking about that, we got through that together, and we’re growing, we’re progressing and we’re moving forward.”

That means she gave him a secNah he’s the type to hate marriage and have no intention to ever walk down the aisle, but he neglects to communicate that clearly even if a woman is wearing an engagement ring and waiting to plan a wedding. A la Shawn Booth. Those guys will lead you on as much as possible knowing full well they’re only wasting your time and they’re not marrying you
