To this day I'm not really sure what "fascism" is, or is supposed to be.  The one-liner definition I was given when in school wasDo you think attributes such as intelligence, personality traits such as empathy, etc. are not affected by genetics, or aren't subject to natural selection?

What's your beef with evolutionary biology?

Cannon's claim that white people are genetically less empathetic, and the explanation why, seem to come by way of Farrakhan and have zero science bFirst, it's obvious that the monolithic coordinated media are purposely (and pointedly) normalizing the demonization of white people as a race, while reaffirming that jews as a race continue to be off-limits for criticism (or however you characterize Cannon's statements about hebrews).
