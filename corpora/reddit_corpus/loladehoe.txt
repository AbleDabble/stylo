To your point, college is expensive and unless you’re rich, specially today in the era of COVID, add to that an economy F’ed by a moron and an F’ed up system that prioritizes the rich while literally sacrificing anyone not rich, then you do what you feel you have to do to get ahead. 

Sometimes it means taking risks you wouldn’t otherwise. 

Just aDo you really think she post with identifying information?

“Hi guys, it’s me X. I live in Y city and here is my face and all my real social media accounts. Love ya”

You don’t have to do full nudes and show your face. 

You can define what you, as the creator, will want to post. There is nothing in the terms of service that requires you to post po&gt; “for people who’s only talent is having a vagina”

Seriously? 

I know a couple of OnlyFan girls who are some of the smartest people I have ever met. 

One is studying quantum field theory because she wants to one day go into a program like CERN and she only does OnlyFans on the side to help with her income. 

Don’t judge a book by its cover jYes. Just be ready to be shot down. Specially if she is with friends. 

But it’s a number game. 

I, being a T, used to go to bars a lot. Guys always approached me and I typically ended up going to bed with them... because I’m a slut. 

Oh, that’s the other thing, don’t assume a girl is a slut just by the way they are dressed. Many times girls dres*googles performative*

Ah, I see. Well it goes to my point, where the men aren’t into it unless you are what I described. 

Compared to women who don’t mind you being you. 

That’s why I wrote that women are, typically, more emotional driven. For the most part they view sex differently then men. 

That’s why a big complaint from women is that men 100% agree. 

That’s why if anyone ever asks my advice about it or even threesomes, open relationships, etc, I always tell them “don’t let porn be your guide” and take stories from other people with a grain of salt. 

Because once you bring someone else into the bedroom there is no going back and there is a big change either he or she will want to Men are easy. It’s women that are complicated, because woman tend to lean more toward emotions. 

I say men, not in that they may not be complexed individuals, but when it comes to sex, most men, not all, really want for you to:

- play with their cocks

- play with their balls

- tell them how good they are (even if they are not)

- moan as they cI always remember:

- If there is a problem and there is a solution, why worry?

- If there is a problem and there is no solution, why worry?

Either case, why worry. 

It has helped me out a lot too see problems in the correct light. 

Sometimes, actually many tines, we make mole hills into mountains. 

If you stand back, take a deep breath and juYour statement “It isn’t normal”, can also be applied to :

- Face fucking her

- Giving her rough sex

- Anally fucking her

- DEGRADING her

-  Doing all of that to her

Isn’t that the poll you posted 7 days ago?

Some people would say, “WTF? Why would you want to degrade her? That’s not normal”. 

So yeah, as long as BOTH parties want it, it’s nYeah, good luck on that. 

Unless the guy is veryyyy desperate, has lots of disposable income and really likes you, why would they want a virtual sugar baby?

For that they can sub to an OnlyFans and pretty much get the same “content” for less the cost. I mean, aside from pics and vids, what else could you offer? Hence “same content” comment. 

I hPut it this way, if you can’t move for a good couple of minutes, you did good. 

Shaking, specially for women, yes, it happens. 

If you barely touch a women who came hard, I mean like a true orgasmic experience, she will shake. May even curl up a bit and tremble.  Because her body is feeling soooo good. 

My motto has always been: 

- If she can gYou should be careful with that too. 

Just because you subscribe and the delete it, doesn’t meant your data was removed from their system. 

They could have just flagged it as deleted. This is called a soft-delete. This means you can no longer see it, but the data is still there. 

That said, they may delete your CC (hard delete), but your name anUnless OnlyFans gets hacked and all that info is exposed. 

That is why it’s better to use a different CC or another method to pay, say PayPal, if allowed. 

Some CCs and banks allow for virtual CC #s. I know Visa does this. 

This way you can use a virtual CC # and if that site gets hacked then your real CC is not exposed.

It’s people who say they are Christians, but just in words. 

Honestly most of those people haven’t even read the Bible. They just spew what they are told at church without though or understanding of it. 

Hell, they scream and yell about how Christian they are, yet they let churches rape little kids overThe average penis size is 5” and change. 

So you’re above average.

Plus like I wrote in a similar post, it’s guys who are more obsessed about size then women. 

Stop letting porn reactions guide you. Pornstars are paid to gawk at penis sizes. 

In Real Life sex is a lot more than size. 

The guy can have the biggest size in the worldThis. 

Guys put more emphasis on dicks then women do. 

Also, don’t based yourself on what you see in Porn. 

In porn all those ladies are paid to gawk and focus on the cock. That’s not how it works in real life (unless you paying for sex). 

Women prefer confidence. That you make them laugh and provide a sense of security and maturity. 

If you kNot for nothing, but all these labels are stupid. 

They really are. 

If it makes you feel special and unique (even though it’s a trend hipsters use) go ahead, but stop telling others to call you that. 

Straight, bi and gay. Understood.

Male, Female and Trans. Makes sense. 

All of those are either opposite sides or in the middle. 

But bi-gendeHow dare you!

I have you know that I never attend Chip &amp; Dale in my life. 

And, ok, so once I had sex with an Inuyasha dude at a con, and yes he had a tail, but I was very drunk and that was anime stuff and I was taken there. Plus I had sex with other non-tail guys there too. Ok!

Don’t you dare put me in the furry category. Don’t you dare!

Try the slow approach. As in, send him naughty messages through you the day. No need for pics. Just erotic, short text. 

Like: “I’m so wet right now”

Or: “I need a throbbing cock IN me”

Stuff like that. 

Guys lean more toward imagination. That’s why a girl in naughty outfit is typically hotter than a totally nekkid girl.

If you get him going tWell, if your dick was hard, would you like it to be slapped gently or punched hard?

I used punch in this comparison because unless you agreed to it and want the pain, you never, ever do rough sex without someone’s consent. And, even if they said yes at first, as soon as there is a “no” or “stop” uttered. You stop. 

Sex is meant to be pleasurableIf your question is more about insecurities or what do girls look for/expect, because you’re looking to be more confident, etc ask that. 

Lots of helpful people here. 

Just be up front and honest. We are all always learning. No one knows everything.... unless you’re Cheesus, our lord and Cheese savior. 

Anywho, I guarantee there is no one who diThen I suggest asking one, well though out question and as the conversation evolves ask subsequent questions. 

The way you wrote your post seemed a bit, I won’t say creepy, but intrusive. 

Like trying to get very specific info about people you don’t know. 

If you have a question, ask it from your point of view: 

“I always wanted to know more abI say, not my thing. Sorry. Straight and to the point. 

I constantly do this with guys with beards. I hate beards. 

I won’t ask him to shave,l because it’s not like we dating, I just say, “Sorry, not into beards. Bye”

I always said that honesty is the best policy, specially when you first meet. It’s easier to just walk away with no hurt feelingsYou don’t post pics of yourself unless you are looking for an ego trip, whether consciously or subconsciously. 

It’s that simple. 

Not that there is anything wrong with it, as long as you’re not some self-centered little prick or bitch to people. 

Who doesn’t love to get a compliment. It’s human nature. 

So imagine getting one about how you looHow about doing it for a month and then writing a paper. 

Remember to have a control group... if you can. 

You must also try to minimized other variables that may influence the results. 

Therefore the test:

* Should always do it at the same time each day

* Should be in a climate control room to account for increase/decreased humidity and otherAlways read her profile. 

See how she presents and describes herself. 

Look at her photos. 

All that gives you a clue about her personality. 

If she is very straight forward about sex and how she’s looking to hook up, she prob won’t like a wall of text about you walking on the beach. But a more straight forward approach and would be more open tGuys typically ask me if I’m a hooker when we first start chatting, because of my profile and how straight forward I am. I’m not, and I never ask for money since I do it for fun. 

But still, some of them would randomly leave money at the end. I always tell them there is no need, but they typically say it’s to help pay for room, the Uber, etc. 

SoSee, that right there is how you tell kids about sex. No beating around the bush. No “birds and bees”. 

Dad: “Ok, let’s talk about sex. Take a sit, son”

Son: “Ok”

Father: “Alrighty. Pay attention. So this is X, that is Y. X goes into Y. Sometimes... ok, many times, there is no Y, so you use Z as a substitute for Y. Now, you have to be careful whI agree. Hence my “it only impacts them” comment. 

This applies to anything that is an opinion. 

Notice I said opinion. Not fact. 

**Opinion**: I love coffee vs I hate coffee.

**Fact**: Earth is round.... that’s it. There is no versus. Anything outside of a fact is a self-center delusion who’s sole purpose is to make that person feel better. 

Maybe in the last century and some people still have that mentality, but today we have MILFs, we have GILFs and based on their respective porn popularity, there are lots, lots, lots and lots of people who agree with you. 

Sexiness has no age. 

You do you. 

That said, there will always be haters no matter what you do. 

You could be the nicest peAlrighty, this is my cup of tea. You ready? Get you pen and paper and listen carefully. 

**1. Never, ever go to a guy.**

He should come you. Preferably a hotel.

Avoid cheap motels, they lack security and are more shady.

Also, don’t tell them where until the day you meet and don’t give him the room number until he is at hotel, ready to come up. Umm, with all due respect, but your stories are giving me some weird vibes. 

* a day ago you had the whole friend who offended you. Said he wants to sleep with you. You spurred his advances (which was fine), but then you were offended by him not saying that you’re not an average girl, etc, etc. 

* about 40 days ago you were trying to find a ReddiWell, girls typically have a lot more to offer than guys. I mean they have the body, the boobs, the ass, the pussy, the legs, etc etc.  

If you into specific fetishes, such as: pantyhose, feet, painted toes, plump lips, hard nipples, etc, they can provide all of that.

One time this guy came to the hotel to meat me (I only let new guys meat me at hotels for safety reasons). 

He was a bit nervous. He kept asking, you’re not a cop, right? 

Now mind you, I’m not a hooker or escort. Dress like one, fuck like one, but am not oneDid you just call me a wimp? 


I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. 

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. 

You are nothing to me but just another target. 

I will wipe yoVery hard, if at all possible, depending on the card. 

The main reason is the one’s selling the gift card want you to use them. 

Why?

Did you ever see that Superman movie where Lex Luther has a devious plan to funnel all the fractions of a cent into one bank account? On their own, a fraction of a cent is nothing, but put billions of them togetheIt’s also a good way to practice lasting long. 

Similar to porn, when the guy stops when he knows the is about to cum. 

Behind the scene they may cut the scene. Wait for him to compose himself and continue where he left off. Or in case of gangbangs, have another guy take over. 

Of course, when you are with a girl you can’t just say: “ok, 5 min tTrust me, it’s not just the looks, to an extent. 

I mean if your some guy who looks like he doesn’t take care of himself, have a dirty room in the background, a stained shirt, etc, that’s a different story. 

Aside from that, if the “girl” you taking too is not a bot or paid by the company to keep guys interested (I knew a girl who did this), thenThere are betas and alphas all around. 

It’s the nature of life. 

Some are more assertive than others. You can also see this with any animal. Except, maybe praying mantis. The females are all basically alphas and will F you up.  

Anyhow, as Moc pointed out, when self appointed alphas use it, it’s typically an insult, but in reality alpha/beta isYou don’t feel him wearing it. It’s more like specialized rubber band, that you put at the base of your penis. 

They work by stopping the guy from ejaculating. 

See, semen has to go from the balls to the head of the penis via a tube. The cock ring puts pressure on the tube, like squeezing a straw. No matter how much you suck on the straw, no liquI’m not an adult store employee, but had the chance to sit behind the counter a couple of times. 

Only 1 time did I hear the employee judge a guy, but it was because the guy seemed very creepy and suspicious. Something about him seemed off. He was in there for like 20 mins and left without buying anything. 

Aside from that they didn’t seem to carSorry, but I disagree. All dicks are the same. The most sensitive part is the head. 

That’s why when guys jerk off, toward the end, their hands is at the top to make themselves cum. 

They are not at the base, the side, etc. they push their hands up and down all the way to the head, because it’s the head part that makes them cum. 

Try it yourselfBe honest. Don’t be a dick though.

This means you don’t need to focus on the weight itself, but rather focus that she was not truthful and tell her that you appreciate honesty. 

Had she been straight forward in her profile it would have been different, but you can’t try to start something based on dishonesty. 

It never works out. 

I could underThis place. 

It’s fun, it’s quirky we go from werewolf’s asking about girls mooning to massive naughty orgies in New Zeland (I hate them). 

I saw a taco yesterday, too. 

Typical conversations range from serious:

“No, for fuck sake don’t do that.”

To comical: 

“Fuck you Taco, I’ll beat you with a Bronie”

It’s pretty nice. 

Oh, we do get inceYou are correct. My wording gave it too broad of an application. 

I should have worded as follows:

“Anything you need to hide, **that your partner should know about**, should make you feel guilty.“

Example of things your partner should know:

* Going to have lunch with your ex (why hide it all there is nothing wrong with it)

* Gambling your comSimple:

Was the sex good?

Yes? Then who cares. 

No? Then who cares. 

Would it bother you if you knew she had been with 10” or 11” guys before?

Would be like “oh, no, we can’t have sex because you had bigger cocks in you then my captain”?

Of course not. 

So why would a big toy bother you? 

Unless you feel that you’re competing with it? 

Be Then tell him straight out. 

If you are both true good friends, he will say “oh, I’m sorry. Promise I won’t do that anymore”. 

Why? Because he cares about his relationship to you as a friend. 

If you both are “friends”, then he may get pissy or be “oh, relax. You get so drama queen”. 

I put the last “friends” in quotes because most people have Wait, you don’t want to date him or sleep with him, but are upset that he didn’t say “nah, you’re not average in my eyes”?

Yeah, overreaction if you ask me, because like you wrote you don’t need validation from him. 

So why do you care? You maybe average to him but a total hottie to another guy. 

I can almost guarantee you can get a lot more dat&gt; It’d be like if someone wanted me to pay them to hang out with me.

Let’s run thru the list of situations where men pay so women do hang out/talk to them, shall we:

* Strip clubs - Check

* Hookers and escorts - Check

* Places using women’s body as a selling point, example Hooters - Check

* Literally any type of only cam show - Check

* DatWell I’m very feminine. I like to think I play my part very well. 

Always silky smooth, smell like lavender sunshine, my voice is very femme, etc. 

Plus I’m super submissive. I only take cock. 

So guys, even “straight” guys, just fuck me the way they would girls. 

Plus I learned a long time ago to moan like a naughty slut, men love that. Someti&gt; What do you do when you don’t know what to think?

You make yourself a nice cup of tea, sit back, take a deep breath and exhale to let your worries and anxieties flow out. Drink your tea and repeat. 

Sometimes is good to just not think. 

I was told once: 

* if there is a problem and there is a solution, then don’t worry. 

* if there is a pCults pray on people with insecurities, or who are looking for the answers... “they want to hear”. 

There wouldn’t be a logical reason why someone would join one. As with any form of veneration toward a thing or person, it’s all based on a shared belief. 

The only different between religion and a cult is that cult are seen as having “sinister intHoney, trust me. If he didn’t like it he wouldn’t be hooking up with you. 

One thing about guys, specially horny guys, is that they are very easy to satisfy. 

Honestly if they cum, now matter how (pussy, mouth, hand, nylon, panty, etc) they are happy little campers. 

If they didn’t like they won’t come back. 

I mean you have married guys, who’sI posted about werewolves in another post about girls mooning and all of the sudden I get a wolf replying to my gay/lez post?

Coincidence? I think not. 

Oh and for the record, Mr Wolf, my question was meant to be silly.

You have to get him to take you off. 

Tell him everyday via text and email. Keep asking: “Did you remove me? I am not going to try to login to check. Just confirm you did.”

If he doesn’t, call his bank and tell them to take you off and that you been telling him to remove you but he hasn’t. They will probably tell yoInstead of an ad, why not turn it into a question with some naughty anecdotes. You can even start with “Hi, girl here”. 

Make sure that what you post is related to the sub.

Trust me, your target audience (aka horny guys), will click on your profile to learn more. 

This means you should have 1 or 2 sexy pics on your profile.

I never ran into an ugggg. Always love it or “cool, but not my thing”. 

I  also have been in bed with many girls, including in couples. We always had lots of fun. 

I will say I am a TV, since I live it 24x7Then in that case, either she will find it cute, corny or weird, depending on her taste. But you can’t control that. 

I been complimented on my skin tone many times (I am Latina), and I found it nice. 

Then again, I also get messages about them dumping their cum on my body... and I find that nice too. 

See, it all depends on the person receivingIf you know her, no matter if she is white, black, green, etc why would she think you’re being racist?

Now, if you telling this to a random woman, no matter if she is white, black, green, etc. that’s creepy. 

You to random white woman: 

“Wow, your skin is as beautiful as the snow white peaks of the tallest mountains.”

You to random black woman:
