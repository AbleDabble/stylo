Yeah totally. There are ways though with Adobe programs that if you make a change to one card that is the template for lots of other cards, all the other cards will change to match it. I'm not exactly sure how to do that but I know it's possible. 

But yeah using premade templates is totally fine if it works for your game. And it'd be easy for a grNice looking cards. My process is still developing but it's somewhere in between these I think. The game I'm making now has 5 card types so I make a basic template for each in Adobe Illustrator and then I just change values and icons as I make new cards. It's a really fast way to make cards. This is after I have sketched layouts/mechanics out on paIf you're planning on self publishing via Kickstarter or something, you'll want to commission enough art to show off in the campaign page and then commission the rest once its funded. Most games will show what some of the art will look like and then maybe say how many individual cards there are with art, etc so people have an idea of what they're pI was actually going to suggest Citadels. It was one of my first games and it's one that I really like. I think if they like Cosmic Encounter they will enjoy Citadels. The newer printing has lots of characters and combinations to play with. It can be kind of mean so a lot of people don't like that part but with all the characters it comes with you Those are wildly different games so comparing prices on them might not be so useful, but maybe send the links to your group. Inis is much more involved and strategic than Colt Express, which is more of a family weight game. That's not to say your group wouldn't like them. Cosmic Encounter is somewhere between them, complexity wise. 

I'd just see wOne Night Ultimate Werewolf, Coup, The Resistance, Werewords. 

If you like bluffing in games, Cockroach Poker is always a fun time and it's dead simple to teach. 

Also excuse the shameless self promotion, but I have a small, 2 player interrogation themed prototype called Polygraph that is "detective vs suspect" and directly involves lying. I can If you have a roommate or a friend willing to learn the game, it's a fantastic casual game to get into. Its pretty easy to make wildly different types of decks once you have enough cards, and you can often find booster boxes for less than $1 per pack these days. 

I haven't played in some time but I still have 1 booster box each of the first 3 setsHomeless people out here include a wide range of people so every interaction could be different. I've had hours long conversations with some homeless folks before as well as many instances of ignoring someone who was clearly mentally ill and could potentially be dangerous. I've actually been hit in the face by a homeless stranger, totally out of thI'm hoping that the recently Kickstarted Mantis Falls fills this niche to some extent. "Scary" isn't exactly what I'd categorize it as but it's got some serious long-form tension that seems to be quite different from many semi-co op games before it. 

But I think there's A LOT of room for horror themed games that actually have you scared playing. II think it helps to keep the scale small too. A game like Onitama works well because players can pretty well see the possibilities but the randomness comes from them not knowing which if the 2 cards their opponent will play. 

When I played Go for the first time, even on a smaller board, the possibilities were just too overwhelming for me to have aI'm in the same boat but tonight I started a spreadsheet just to keep track of everything and it's been helpful. 

My game has a drafting round, and you pay for the cards you want to keep after everyone has drafted. But the cards you don't pay for are available to all the other players during the action round that follows, at a discounted cost. WheI only have a few designs that have gotten to a playable state and one that is pretty much finished but I usually start working on the game with a strong theme in mind and a rough idea of the type of gameplay I want. Both of those things can change as the game develops but usually it's the mechanics that change if anything. 

I don't think I'd everAs someone working on a few designs myself, TTS is pretty much the most useful design tool i can think of outside of maybe a computer. To be able to hav ba playable game without printing anything and to be able to play that with someone over the internet is immensely helpful. It's incredibly intuitive to make games on TTS, much easier than I first After watching reviews of Pendulum, I'd still say that the games you mentioned have stronger themes than Pendulum...as I couldn't even tell you what the theme of Pendulum actually is. Sure, all of these games don't have the most thematic gameplay but I'd still say a lot of the actions make sense thematically...like forcing your opponent to spend reI actually think my biggest complaint is the theme. Of all the cool themes that would go along with having sand timers, this looks just like another vague, generic fantasy-esque theme that doesn't really have much to do with the mechanics of time. 

Kitchen Rush makes sense, Pandemic Rapid Response makes sense, but this doesn't make much sense to mYeah it's a fairly complex game as it is like 90% Gloomhaven. But I can also say that the tutorial games (games 1-5) do a fantastic job of teaching it. I have yet to really feel overwhelmed by the complexity. 

That's actually why I recommended Jaws of the Lion over the original. The original just gives you a rulebook and throws you in. Jaws of theThis game 2p is similar to other similar route/economic games in that you just have more workers and options. I've actually only played it 2p so far but I never feel like there is a lot of conflict in a 2p game because you can kind of just do your own thing on one side of the world for most the game. That's not to say I don't enjoy it though! I thiWe all go through periods of feeling down on ourselves. It's inevitable. But we have to be kind to ourselves. We need to stop thinking about what's wrong with us and start asking  "What can I do to make me feel better about myself?" And often thats not changing something about ourselves, but rather changing how we look at ourselves. Because there'sMy friend, 5'9" is not short. Remember that 5'10" is about average male height. I'm 5'8" on a good day and I've dated women much taller than myself. It doesn't matter. I have a dead front tooth that's discolored, a crooked jaw from when I broke it as a 20 year old, an eye that is slightly closed all the time and a huge nose that seems to be gettingHave you ever sought therapy? You have to remember that people are attracted to those who have put effort into self improvement. You can't love anyone else unless you love yourself first. That sounds corny but it's absolutely true. 

I started therapy a lil over a year ago and I gotta tell you, it's life changing. I wish everyone could do it. So, iI don't think it's too soon necessarily but it really is different for everyone. If you think he really likes you and wants to keep seeing you then maybe give it a few more dates? I've known people and dated people when I was younger (I'm 28) who did not like texting so I don't think that's very strange, he's probably being honest about that. 

ButI really like Vallejo. I think the downtown has some pretty cool, historic buildings and the surrounding area has nice, old houses. You can get some really good views of the water from parts of the city. And it's not just ethnically diverse, it's actually one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country: 32% White, 22% Black, 22% Hispanic/LShe might be going through something right now and it might not have anything to do with you. She might even be distancing herself from multiple people. You never know. 

But no matter the case, if it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't. There are so many smart, beautiful people in the world that if it doesn't work out with one of them, YOUMy advice is that if your teeth are affecting your dental health, then seek help from a dentist if you can.  

But if your insecurities are because of something purely cosmetic, try and see your teeth as something that makes you unique. 

I broke my jaw when I was 20 (now 28) and now my jaw is a little crooked, it leans to one side a little. I alsoYeah this commenter is out of line. What you experienced was a mix of racism and sexism and what they said is purely coming from a place of ignorance and hate. I can't imagine what that kind of language does to you emotionally and I'm so sorry that happened to you. 

But those are the absolute last people on Earth who should have any say in what isI went to GameStorm in Portland a couple years ago because my job was a vendor and I lived close by. It was OK. It's a small con so I wasn't expecting much and it was more or less what I expected. People were nice, there was lots of table space for gaming. The best part of the con was how late the play area was open til. 

And last year I went to SI think what you're looking for is something that isn't popular... yet. But I think we are going to see a lot more innovation in legacy games coming soon. At the moment, the majority of legacy games that play well at 2p are co-op games. The competitive legacy games usually require 3p to have the full experience. I think My City works at multiple plI have only played a bit of Clank Legacy with 3p so I can't speak to its gameplay with 2, but given that it's pretty much just Clank with extra stuff (which I have played at 2p) I'd probably avoid Clank Legacy unless you had 3+ players. The tension just isn't there as much with only 2 players in my opinion. It's one of those games where 2 is ok, 3 **Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion** - Almost done with the 5 game tutorial. Loving it so far! My girlfriend and I are very stoked on it so far. 

**Pan Am** - Another new one that my girlfriend and I really enjoy. It's a very solid 2 player game but I imagine that it would be even more interesting at 3-4p. It's so beautiful though and easy to play. WeI'm working on a game that is sci fi bounty hunter themed that has a similar mechanic. Players draft "contacts" that they pay to put into their tableau. These contact cards give them some abilities but they also correlate to the known contacts on the bounties they are trying to fulfill. When a player has the right combination of known contacts for Just avoid a pun that's pushing it's limits. "Atlandice" is a good example of a game that I almost don't want to play because of the name.

Keep it short, relevant, unique and memorable. 

Some good examples from my collection:
Dead of Winter
Codenames
Keyforge
The Bloody Inn
Mint Works
Potion Explosion

All of these titles are very directIf you're interested in Gloomhaven I would definitely try and start with Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion first. It's great and much cheaper than Gloomhaven (though with understandably less content). Other good co-op games I've played at two player are Horrified, Rising 5, Forbidden Desert, or Sylvion but they all follow a fairly standard co-op format.Castles of Burgundy, Watergate, Isle of Cats, Brass: Lancashire, Century: Spice Road, The Bloody Inn, and Race/Roll for the Galaxy are currently my favorite two player games. 

For your tastes I think Castles of Burgundy and Isle of Cats would maybe be a good 2p substitute for Architects, they are of similar weight/length. 

Brass: Lancashire is a I would not play that as a legal word with my interpretation of the rules. I think that's part of the challenge of the game. Like for example, I would also say that "peanut butter" is not a valid clue as it's two words, despite peanut butter being used so often as a singular thing. Maybe you say peanut or butter instead and hope they make the conneCheck out r/Tabletopgamedesign . 

Board game design is a lot more difficult than it may seem going into it. But my advice is to rapidly prototype your game so you can playtest and reiterate over and over again. Don't focus much on the "look" of the game early on. Just make sure it's functional at first so you can get your design fleshed out. 

I fSounds like you enjoy Zelda. But using sales as the core criteria for quality in any medium has lots of faults. You'll probably notice that the Transformers movies were nominated for far more Golden Raspberries than they were Academy Awards, despite their massive ticket sales. I'll admit that video games are a little bit different. Usually a game wI bought the game and I enjoy it, but not as much as I initially did. My issue is that the interaction in the game is really just looking out for triggers on other peoples' cards on both your turn and their turn. Almost every game I have played, some things that were supposed to trigger get missed. It's not a complicated game, and maybe that's most1. Your talking about video games to board games, different mediums. 

2. Dark Souls and BOTW are both highly critically acclaimed games. Both rank in IGN's top 20 of their 100 best games of all time so saying one is better than other is really only a matter of opinion at that point. 

I just don't really understand the argument of "This is how a dI'm on the lower end of the economic spectrum here so our ideal budget is around $350k for a house. We considered a condo but HOA fees out here are pretty absurd in some places so it wasn't really worth considering. But $350k is also a safe number for us too, that leaves room for unexpected repairs, life happenings, etc. So Vallejo is really the onIf you liked Gloomhaven, maybe see if you can get a copy of Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. I haven't played the original but from what I understand, Jaws of the Lion fixes all the setup issues (scenario tiles are now a spiral bound scenario book). 

You also might like some deckbuilding games that have you building decks in game. This is a lot less Currently playing Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion with my partner as our first Gloomhaven experience. I highly recommend it! If you are in the states, it's coming back into stock at Targets around the country. I own Scythe and Cyclades, both great games but they aren't the best 2p experiences. So if that's something you want, I would hold off on thoseVallejo/Benicia is probably a happy medium. Commuting from SF to Napa would really suck. But if you wanted to go out on weekends in SF, Oakland or Berkeley, you could absolutely do that living in Vallejo/Benicia. Without traffic, Vallejo is about 30 min driving from Oakland. There's also a ferry that goes from Vallejo to SF if you didn't want to dr1. I've lived here 10 years, pretty much in Oakland the entire time but I've lived in North, West and East Oakland. 

2. The main reason I don't see myself here long term is that the only place I'd maybe be able to afford to buy my first home is in Vallejo. And I actually like Vallejo, but I'd likely have to commute to Oakland/Berkeley for work and**Chinatown** is definitely the perfect replacement for Monopoly, judging by the way your roommates play. Every round, everyone is trying to make deals with each other in real time (meaning nobody has turns). It's just totally chaotic and fun, because you can trade any combination of money, properties, business tiles. We do a house rule though wherI haven't played too many of these types of games, but I can see the point of playing the 1 as being more fun than playing on the many team. 

Some designs combat the quarterbacking with players having to cooperate with limited information. Like they can say what they want to do or what they plan on doing without offering explicit information. 

**I agree that I don't think fun should be seen as something throwaway. And I think Cole's take on fun could make it seem that he feels that way, maybe he does. I hold the idea of fun in higher regard. 

But I also think that I watched the movie because I was looking for an experience that a history book wouldn't have offered. I mean ultimately one iI don't think you are wrong at all. I don't think there's really a right or wrong to this. I just think he's saying games have evolved to this place where you can play them for other experiences that are not necessarily centered around fun. 

This analogy might not apply but I don't think there's anything particularly entertaining about watching ScI definitely don't think he's saying those two things are mutually exclusive. He's saying that he doesn't like to design games with the goal of being fun as the central design goal because that can often lead to too many compromises with the intent of appealing to a broader definition of fun, thus making the game "less good" (to him) for the sake oLisboa and Great Western Trail both have 12+ on their boxes. Rarely does a game go over 14+ even if they are incredibly complex board games. The minimum age is not really something to base a game's target market...it's more so about the minimum age someone could play this game. As for Root, ages 10 years or older might be accurate. That's not sayinSounds like **Millennium Blades** is the game for you. It's essentially a trading card game simulation board game. I haven't played it myself but it ranks pretty high on BGG and I've heard a lot of good things about it. 

You may also like a variety of deckbuilding games such as **Dominion**, **Star Realms**, **Clank!**, **Hand of Fate: Ordeals**, I think a game like Poker works well in this way because there is huge risk and huge reward. 

I probably wouldn't play a board game that lasted for a long time but also with the potential for player elimination early in the game. What's arguably worse though, is a game with no player elimination but a runaway leader problem that can be seen from tI think the argument he is trying to make is that there's this common idea that board games should be designed around having fun in lieu of exploring the emotional range that a game could have...that fun could be a result of that exploration but not necessarily the goal. And I don't think he's right or wrong about this, it's just one way or approacI'm 4 scenarios in and I haven't noticed anything besides one of my cards having a slight ink blotch on the back. I guess it could have an effect if I was looking for it but if the 5 times I've played, I never noticed it. 

I imagine that there will surely be typos as there is a lot of written content but that's kind of to be expected with games liIf you enjoy theme I've read that Escape Plan is the most accessible Vital Lacerda game and also one of the more thematic of his games. It's not as highly ranked as the Gallerist but still considered a great game and the entry point to Lacerda games. I have not played either myself though, that's just what I've been told. 

I have played both BrassI think even if your end goal is to make digital art, you will be a much better artist of you don't need to rely on the digital tools to make perfect lines. 

Most digital illustrators still draw very similarly to how they would with pen/paper and the fundamentals of Draw A Box is the completely transferrable to digital art. 

You can sort of thinkThere are tons of professional artists that cut corners all the time so they can meet deadlines, etc. One might say a "bad" artist is someone who makes those cut corners noticeable. I think if you are cutting those corners to make things easier for yourself, that's totally fine. You may be cheating yourself in the long run though by not working on 100 % agree. Even when my table would allow me to take back an action I usually just roll with it and see it as an added challenge/hurdle to get through. Making decisions without knowing whether or not they are absolutely the right decision is a huge part of playing board games. 

If on every turn, the ability to make the absolute right decision waI don't necessarily know about "illegal" as artists like Richard Prince have made lots of money by appropriating other photos, but it's definitely wrong in mine and most peoples' opinion.

I basically spent my college years not going to college, but rather hanging out with all my friends that were in art school, so much so that they're fellow students all thought I went to their school too. 

I think "boring" is pretty valid feedback. Sure it's subjective but if multiple people said my game was boring then I'd definitely go back to the drawing board. 

But keep in mind that game designs are works in progress so you shouldn't open your game up to feedback unless you're willing for your game to be criticized (as that is the whole point).
