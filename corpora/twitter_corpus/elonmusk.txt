@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!

@flcnhvy 🤣🤣

RT @SpaceX: SpaceX and @NASA completed a full rehearsal of launch day activities with the four Crew-2 astronauts https://t.co/u0hDCTx3Zp

@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle https://t.co/6lGy52wVhC

@WhatsupFranks Great progress by Tesla team

If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars

@neuralink @shivon Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. 

Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. 

Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.

Everything to the moon!

We are honored to be part of the @NASAArtemis team

RT @Tesla: Cybertruck at Giga Texas https://t.co/c1RuektPnN

🎸🎸 Austin Rocks!! 🎸 🎸

@Model3Owners Same with Berlin

@Model3Owners Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year

@Model3Owners I was just there, driving Cybertruck around the site where it will be built!

Make life multiplanetary! #Mars

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.

@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.

@sadiaslayy @DogecoinBets 😮

@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!

@austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week

@billhuang688 @RationalEtienne @F9Block5 Certainly one of the largest. A company whose name rhymes with Shmoogle is pretty far ahead. 

But I think we’re the leader in shallow-minded AI haha!

@RationalEtienne @F9Block5 While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.

Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard.

@SpaceXMR Soon it will be real

@janixos @ErcXspace @SpaceX Actually, yes. And Red Rocket truck stop.

@andyweedman @karpathy @DirtyTesla Stop … In the Name of Love! https://t.co/kBsTi5jz16

@AustinTeslaClub @TslaCC @teslaquadcities @teslaownersvn @SjvTesla @TeslaOwnersEBay @CodingMark @billhuang688 @gailalfa1 @Tesla 🥰

@Teslarati I found some footage of the drive https://t.co/TXeLQO9Spr

@AstroJordy @dogeofficialceo @F9Block5 Insanely cute!

@WholeMarsBlog Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.

@cliffski @F9Block5 Hopefully addressed this summer

@dogeofficialceo @F9Block5 🤣🤣

@BLKMDL3 @F9Block5 Same timing

@F9Block5 Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.

This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.

@jrosinski97 Will investigate

@melaniemadri Probably late July

Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.

@ErcXspace @SpaceX 69th Raptor engine coming soon

@ashleevance Maybe it’s about how you use it

@PPathole @SwiftOnSecurity Getting there

@AstroJordy @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That version of Falcon 1 never flew, so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then.

@eugenelee3 @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.

@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.

@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla True. Ancient times … Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow.

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Absolutely

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.

@vincent13031925 For now. Costs are decreasing rapidly.

Love this beautiful shot
