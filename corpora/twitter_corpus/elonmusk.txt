Starship SN15 static fire completed, preparing for flight later this week

@jeff_foust True 🤣🤣

@kchangnyt Can’t get it up (to orbit) lol

@heydave7 Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023

@stoolpresidente No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.

@jgrano305 @Orangetilt Yes

@Orangetilt Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. 

What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!

@PPathole An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)

@PPathole True. The opposite in fact – I provide financial support to my parents.

@AstroJordy I’m staying at a friend’s place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. 

When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice.

@28delayslater Does seem a little weird

@OwenSparks_ @AstroJordy @neuralink 🤣

@JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. 

If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …

Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility

@jack True

@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.

@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.

Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. 

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. 

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.

Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.

Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery

@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.

@WholeMarsBlog Exactly

@NASA Awesome!

@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.

@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!

@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle https://t.co/6lGy52wVhC

If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars

@neuralink @shivon Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. 

Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. 

Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.

@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.

@sadiaslayy @DogecoinBets 😮

@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!

@billhuang688 @RationalEtienne @F9Block5 Certainly one of the largest. A company whose name rhymes with Shmoogle is pretty far ahead.
