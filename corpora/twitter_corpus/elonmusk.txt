@engineers_feed Due to lower gravity, you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket. Earth to Mars is vastly harder.

@DrPhiltill Good thread

@alexellisuk Pretty much

@tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.

@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

@WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.

@WholeMarsBlog This is a major problem!

Just needs some legs

The Starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically Mechazilla

But wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? Stop asking questions!!
