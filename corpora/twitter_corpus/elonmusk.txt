@ErcXspace @SpaceX 69th Raptor engine coming soon

@ashleevance Maybe it‚Äôs about how you use it

@PPathole @SwiftOnSecurity Getting there

@AstroJordy @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That version of Falcon 1 never flew, so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then.

@eugenelee3 @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.

@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.

@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla True. Ancient times ‚Ä¶ Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow.

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Absolutely

@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their ‚Äúapproved‚Äù collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.

@vincent13031925 For now. Costs are decreasing rapidly.

Love this beautiful shot

@seinfeldguru @WholeMarsBlog Nope haha

@WholeMarsBlog If you don‚Äôt say anything &amp; engage Autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to what‚Äôs on your calendar

@DeltavPhotos @PortCanaveral That rocket is a hardcore veteran of many missions

@engineers_feed Due to lower gravity, you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket. Earth to Mars is vastly harder.

@DrPhiltill Good thread

@alexellisuk Pretty much

@tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.

@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

@WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.

@WholeMarsBlog This is a major problem!

Just needs some legs

The Starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically Mechazilla

But wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? Stop asking questions!!

Kong vs Godzilla has record for most meth ever consumed in a writer‚Äôs room

@itsALLrisky üíØ

‚Ä¶ going to moon very soon

@Matsu_Kusarine @jagarikin Actually happened to me in Cyberpunk haha

@TimBirks1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Pretty much

@memescryptor !

Where is Shrek 5!? https://t.co/PqAZ5Mg8Es

@AustinTeslaClub @OwenSparks_ @WholeMarsBlog Good point. 

Next major software rev will do much better with automating wipers, seat heating &amp; defrost. 

Probable seat settings just based on occupant mass distribution should be possible.

@Adamklotz_ @OwenSparks_ @WholeMarsBlog Yup

@teslaownersSV @neuralink Turns out üêí love video games &amp; snacks just like us!

It‚Äôs all about the cufflinks https://t.co/elccqC0Zuf

@chicago_glenn I feel like this sometimes
