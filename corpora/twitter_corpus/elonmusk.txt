@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.

@teslaownersSV cgi irl!

@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX I could get a job, just not at an Internet company (weren’t many back then)

@Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true

@JohnnaCrider1 !!

@kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space

@kimpaquette NHTSA is great

@RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha

@GerberKawasaki 🤣

@WholeMarsBlog Exactly

@NASA Awesome!

@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.

@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!

@flcnhvy 🤣🤣

@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle https://t.co/6lGy52wVhC

Dragon spacecraft &amp; Falcon 9 rocket https://t.co/A6fsNlsN9z

@WhatsupFranks Great progress by Tesla team

If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars

@neuralink @shivon Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. 

Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. 

Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.

Everything to the moon!

We are honored to be part of the @NASAArtemis team

🎸🎸 Austin Rocks!! 🎸 🎸

@Model3Owners Same with Berlin

@Model3Owners Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year

@Model3Owners I was just there, driving Cybertruck around the site where it will be built!

Make life multiplanetary! #Mars

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.

@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.

@sadiaslayy @DogecoinBets 😮

@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!

@austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week

@billhuang688 @RationalEtienne @F9Block5 Certainly one of the largest. A company whose name rhymes with Shmoogle is pretty far ahead. 

But I think we’re the leader in shallow-minded AI haha!

@RationalEtienne @F9Block5 While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.

Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard.

@AstroJordy @dogeofficialceo @F9Block5 Insanely cute!

@WholeMarsBlog Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.

@cliffski @F9Block5 Hopefully addressed this summer

@dogeofficialceo @F9Block5 🤣🤣

@BLKMDL3 @F9Block5 Same timing

@F9Block5 Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.

This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.

@jrosinski97 Will investigate

@melaniemadri Probably late July
