@Erdayastronaut @Twisi80 Testing header tanks. All good so far.

@leastImAlive @thesheetztweetz They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo. 

Strange that they aren’t taking more action on some of the SPACs.

@thesheetztweetz FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators! 

On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn’t anticipate.

@garyblack00 Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. 

I trust the people.

@DocumentingBTC Yes

@PPathole Yup

@garyblack00 @CGrantWSJ @WSJ I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications.

@Orangetilt Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. 

What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!

@PPathole An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)

@PPathole True. The opposite in fact – I provide financial support to my parents.
