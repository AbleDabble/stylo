@Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true

@JohnnaCrider1 !!

@kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space

@kimpaquette NHTSA is great

@RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha

RT @SpaceX: Falcon 9 and Dragon are looking good for flight of Crew-2 astronauts; teams are keeping an eye on launch site and downrange weaâ€¦

@WholeMarsBlog Exactly

@NASA Awesome!

@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.

@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanityâ€™s future in space is super appreciated. Letâ€™s make the sci-fi future we want real!

@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesnâ€™t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle https://t.co/6lGy52wVhC

Dragon spacecraft &amp; Falcon 9 rocket https://t.co/A6fsNlsN9z

@WhatsupFranks Great progress by Tesla team

If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars

@neuralink @shivon Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. 

Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. 

Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.

Everything to the moon!

We are honored to be part of the @NASAArtemis team
