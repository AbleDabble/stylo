@AstroJordy I’m staying at a friend’s place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. 

When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice.

@28delayslater Does seem a little weird

@OwenSparks_ @AstroJordy @neuralink 🤣

@JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. 

If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …

Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility

@jack True

@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.

@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.

Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. 

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. 

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.

Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.

Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery

@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.

@teslaownersSV cgi irl!

@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX I could get a job, just not at an Internet company (weren’t many back then)

@Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true

@JohnnaCrider1 !!

@kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space

@kimpaquette NHTSA is great

@RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha

@WholeMarsBlog Exactly

@NASA Awesome!

@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.

@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!

@flcnhvy 🤣🤣

RT @SpaceX: SpaceX and @NASA completed a full rehearsal of launch day activities with the four Crew-2 astronauts https://t.co/u0hDCTx3Zp

@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle https://t.co/6lGy52wVhC

Dragon spacecraft &amp; Falcon 9 rocket https://t.co/A6fsNlsN9z

@WhatsupFranks Great progress by Tesla team

If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars

@neuralink @shivon Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. 

Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. 

Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.

Everything to the moon!

@Model3Owners Same with Berlin

@Model3Owners Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year

@Model3Owners I was just there, driving Cybertruck around the site where it will be built!

Make life multiplanetary! #Mars

@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.

@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.

@sadiaslayy @DogecoinBets 😮

@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!

@austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week

@billhuang688 @RationalEtienne @F9Block5 Certainly one of the largest. A company whose name rhymes with Shmoogle is pretty far ahead. 

But I think we’re the leader in shallow-minded AI haha!
