Home is where the 💛 is 
but God I 💛 the UK!!! url

I wanted to say thank you to you so today I will be addressing a very pressing issue. 🐈🐈‍⬛❓ url

WELL WELL WELL you all really went out and left my greatest expectations in shambles this week.😆 Word on the street is you made Fearless (my version) the biggest country album 1st week of the last 6 years &amp; the top release of 2021 so far. Honestly?? How?? Did I get this lucky??

Said hey to Stephen the other day

RT @youtubemusic: *Cries in Fearless* “Taylor’s Version” is here and now we can relive @taylorswift13’s sophomore album like it’s the first…

This is more than perfectly fine 😄 @amazonmusic url url

You can listen to That’s When (feat. @KeithUrban) and You All Over Me (feat. @MarenMorris) on the Today’s Country playlist on @AppleMusic! 💛 url url

It was the night things changed. Fearless (Taylor’s Version) is out now: url url

You ok? NO cause I sent my two kids @Olivia_Rodrigo and @conangray my new version of You Belong With Me and THEY ARE SO CUTE IT PHYSICALLY HURTS ME 
((Album out at midnight!)) url

Me in 2020: life is chill, writing songs based in fiction to avoid drama, feeling pretty grown up 

My 2008 music from the vault, in a goblin voice: “REELEEEEEEASE MR PERFECTLY FIIIIIIINE” 

url

I’m counting down the minutes til we can all jump into this brave world together, filled with equal parts nostalgia and brand newness. 

Head first, Fearless 💛

I’m really honored that @KeithUrban  is a part of this project, duetting on That’s When and singing harmonies on We Were Happy. I was his opening act during the Fearless album era and his music has inspired me endlessly.

You cracked the codes and guessed all the From The Vault titles. 👏👏👏 Here’s the full track list, my friends. url

The vault door is about to be as unhinged as you’ll think I am after you watch this video.

Level: Expert

Happy decoding! url

You All Over Me (feat. @MarenMorris) (From The Vault) and Love Story (Taylor’s Version) - Elvira Remix are out now because in this house we dance and cry at the SAME TIME 💛😭💃 

url url

@IAMANITABAKER I’m cheering you on in your fight to get back your work, and appreciate your support so much!! Thank you 🙏 💗

You All Over Me is produced by Aaron Dessner and co-written by Scooter Carusoe - can’t wait for you to hear it 💛

One thing I’ve been loving about these From The Vault songs is that they’ve never been heard, so I can experiment, play, and even include some of my favorite artists. I’m really excited to have @MarenMorris singing background vocals on this song!! ☔️

HI. I wanted to let you know that the first “From the Vault” song I’m releasing from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) comes out tomorrow at midnight eastern. It’s called You All Over Me (From The Vault). url

a marvelous time 🥲 url

The fans are the reason we’re floating tonight, and we’ll never forget it. url

@DavidArchie I LOVE THIS!!! 🤩🤩🤩

Hey Ginny &amp; Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back. How about we stop degrading hard working women by defining this horse shit as FuNnY. Also, @netflix after Miss Americana this outfit doesn’t look cute on you 💔 Happy Women’s History Month I guess url

I miss you terribly and can’t wait til we can all safely be at shows together again 💘 url

YES!!! Fingers crossed and praying that the Senate will see trans and lgbtq rights as basic human rights. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸 url

Hey guys so who’s gonna tell 18 year old me that our love story would still be going strong all these years later? 🥺 Thanks for the ways you fill my life with love 24/7, every damn day. Happy Valentines Day 💛 💛

In my mind all of the evermore and folklore album ladies are a part of the same universe, so I put them in a playlist together 💛💛 url url

the “forever is the sweetest con” chapter is out now 💛💛  url url

A new album means new chapters ✨ the “dropped your hand while dancing” chapter is out now: url url

The first is a song about a girl who stayed forever in the exact spot where her heart was broken, completely frozen in time. “it’s time to go” is about listening to your gut when it tells you to leave. How you always know before you know, you know? 🍂

the evermore deluxe album with 2 bonus tracks “right where you left me” and “it’s time to go” is now available! url url

url url

bye 2020, it’s been weird. url

boxing day 📦 url

@katyperry THIS IS GENIUS url

Guys.
Seriously.
Thank you for doing this. url

Everyone stream/buy McCartney III because it’s excellent but also because Paul is the kind of friend who steps in to help you when your boot is stuck. If not for him, it would still be on there. 👢😂 url

Footage of evermore, folklore and lover hearing this news 😆🎉 url url

I’m a huge fan of these two already but seeing them create magic in the studio together just makes me even more excited to hear what they do in the future - absolutely love this, what a gift 🎁🥺🥰 url

My dad watched this interview and said ‘@zanelowe knows you maybe even better than you know yourself’. So while I spend years processing that possibility, here’s the video of our chat! url @AppleMusic url
