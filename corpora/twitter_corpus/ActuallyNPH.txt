Happy Easter, everyone! As my great, Great Uncle Seamus said: ‘May your eggs be well hidden, and may ye discover each and every one, so they don’t wind up weeks later, moldy and rotting, and teeming with salmonella!’  (I’m paraphrasing, but it was something equally inspired...)

&lt;&lt; shakes Magic 8-Ball &gt;&gt;  ‘As I see it, yes.’  &lt;&lt; shakes again &gt;&gt; ‘It is decidedly so’. I guess I’m in. url

If you have ever been moved by magic, stop your world and watch @derek_del’s brilliant In And Of Itself, now on @hulu. It’s a master class in storytelling, a performance on a whole other level. Impeccably directed by @TheFrankOzJam. Super proud of all involved. url

Hope those that can are watching #ItsASin, which premiered tonight on @Channel4. It was a sincere honor to be part of something so epic, yet so intimate. Bravo @russelldavies63  for being brilliant. @REDProductionCo

@clmazin @theory11 I’m chuffed that you enjoyed it! Well  played, good sir. Your kind words mean a lot.

Thank you for bringing attention to this important issue. Box ONE is my intellectual property, and this means a lot to me. If you play the game, you’ll understand... #boxonegame url url

Well @Davidburtka and I were quite flattered to be part of @people Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive issue, aaaand then we realized they just wanted us for our our dogs...  Stings, but still worth it.  url

Beyond excited to begin reading the new book by @AnthonyHorowitz, Moonflower Murders. It’s predecessor, Magpie Murders, is one of my favorite books ever. Cannn’t waaaait. #murdermystery url

To all of our veterans and current military members, those who represent our country and put their lives on the line, every day - thank you. I salute you. #VeteransDay2020

I’m a fan of @chrisramsay52 and share his love of puzzles, magic, and escape-y things. Had a legit good time being interviewed on his YT channel about my new game, Box ONE (though it was a tad frustrating at the end). Check it out: url

Congratulations to my friends at @NTScontractors. Your constant hard work has paid off yet again: another project featured on the cover of Architectural Digest, five years after ours! Keep it up! #proud url

@EscThisPodcast I don’t expect it (in fact I like the palate cleansing of a vastly different experience), but when they do connect (like @thebasementER)... it’s glorious.

Be you. Be proud. #NationalComingOutDay ❤️@Davidburtka url

RT @AlexDinelaris: These will now become my go to restaurants when the covid has lifted. Well done #nizzanyc &amp; #marseillenyc really well do…

@stu_turton I just finished Seven Deaths. It was an absolutely wonderful read. Thanks for keeping the whodunnit so inspired, and inspiring. Well done.

Is it a seance? A puzzle box? Something that will now reside in my house? I have no idea what’s in this terrifying box! But I’m getting one... Join me? url url

Not out juuuust yet. 10/4 is the shelf date at @Target. For those that don’t know: Box One - a party game for just one - will be awesome. url url

Loving the podcast @FinishItPod. Two brothers hilariously discuss every single option in Choose Your Own Adventure books from the ‘80s. A wonderful listen. I’m digging Who Killed Harlowe Thromby. url

Tim, stop with the inspiration. You’re making my exercise regime pale in comparison, and I’m already pale enough..! @tim_cook url

Virtual book tour tonight, in a few hours! It’s on Zoom, so we can see each other, chat, I’ll answer your questions, it’ll be...magic. Come play! url url

Magic Misfits: the Fourth Suit comes out TOMORROW! It’s the final book in the series. The concluding course in the meal. The last piece in the quadriptych. The terminal stop on the train. The end, um, thing in the thing. Buy a copy now! url #themagicmisfits
