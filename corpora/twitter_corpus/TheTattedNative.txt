Hello old friend, how I've missed you..

This little guy's name is Golly. He had been beside me since birth, keeping me protected against monsters, aliens, and the dark. He's helped me out, but now  it's his turn to help out someone else. My son is going to love you Golly, just like I did.

Before I started to upgrade my PC, I ended up getting my #secretlabs chair, and damn do I not regret it at all. Especially since before I was only using the cheapest chair that Staples had to offer. Game changer.

This mic has been with me since my music days, almost 10 years ago, and during stream it's still going strong. Can't beat the Shure 55SH

When it comes to getting that right angle for my shot on stream, this little #kingjoy tripod attachment is solid. Even holding up a #Sonya6000 , and a full lens, this thing is strong and reliable.
