They created a ripple effect of impact felt around the world.

Here’s a look at how one of them, @suta_bombay, made it happen. url

*some uplifting news* 

In the face of all of 2020's challenges

our merchants:

contributed over $307B in economic impact worldwide
created 3.6M jobs 
and generated $20B+ in cross-border sales

We call this the Shopify Effect.

@milaapdotorg This fundraiser is focused specifically on Swasth Digital Health Foundation along with ACT Grants to procure oxygen concentrators and channel them to hospitals across levels of care in remote areas for COVID response.

@GiveIndia is also working on the ground and providing free oxygen cylinders, food, and sanitary napkins to people impacted by COVID in New Delhi &amp; Mumbai.

@Hemkunt_Fdn based in Punjab, the NGO Hemkunt Foundation has been working on the ground by providing free oxygen cylinders to COVID-19 patients.

We’re thinking about our merchants, partners, and their communities at large throughout India, as news breaks about the increasingly dire state of the pandemic in the country. 

If you’re looking for ways to support, we’ve threaded some resources you can use to directly help.

Yesterday's verdict in the murder of George Floyd is a sign of hope but it is not a victory. While we honour his memory and this moment, the work to combat racism in all of its forms must continue with urgency. We stand with the Black community—not just yesterday, but every day.
