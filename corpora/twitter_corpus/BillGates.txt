Ambitious short-term goals like this are critical to moving closer to a net-zero future. As we rapidly scale the solutions we have, we must also invest in innovation to reach our ultimate goals. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership. https://t.co/SVeKp1KPHT

It‚Äôs encouraging to see @POTUS Biden and @ClimateEnvoy Kerry re-establish America‚Äôs leading role on climate change. I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster. https://t.co/a9CXZzIg6Y

Yesterday's verdict was a step in the right direction. But one court ruling alone will not bring to an end the injustice and inequity that Black people experience daily.  I hope we will continue to make real progress on this.

‚ÄúTime‚Äù is a poetic portrait of a family who love and support each other despite their difficult circumstances. I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. https://t.co/pxkDEmL2SR

If ‚ÄúTime‚Äù wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley‚Äôs talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME https://t.co/37x1gfWZgZ

Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it‚Äôs not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that. https://t.co/VIaM9385bv

To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It‚Äôs encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year. https://t.co/9bLQJvfZIR

Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody. Stephaun and his colleagues at @FredHutch are working to reach the people who are usually left behind. https://t.co/7wqSeT3DJN

The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn‚Äôt count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.) https://t.co/b8tSNNdUBy https://t.co/bFrIIUv97i

Cement is responsible for 6% of carbon emissions globally. To get to net-zero by 2050, we need innovations to decarbonize the material. I discuss a few approaches to make low-emission cement in my climate book: https://t.co/Ok1p3xQir4

Moving to a green economy is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. I‚Äôm optimistic we can do it, but need to make sure it benefits everyone‚Äîincluding those workers and communities who depend on the fossil fuels that we need to get rid of. https://t.co/UsjyfdOuQi

We can‚Äôt avoid a climate disaster without corporate leaders making courageous decisions now. I hope to work with @VWGroup on building the markets for the clean technologies the world needs. Thank you for the kind words, Herbert. https://t.co/BgC6pJoql2

Delivering vaccines to those who need them most, no matter where they live or how much money they have, is the only way to end the pandemic and begin the recovery. This is an important milestone. https://t.co/PY5kjk63wr

@EU_H2020 @EIB @Breakthrough @BloomBiorenewa1 To get to net zero, we need innovation to replace fossil fuels in everyday products like plastics. @BloomBiorenewa1 is one of the many companies leading on this important work.
