I was honored to speak at today’s #LeadersClimateSummit about the three things we need to do to avoid a climate disaster. url

Ambitious short-term goals like this are critical to moving closer to a net-zero future. As we rapidly scale the solutions we have, we must also invest in innovation to reach our ultimate goals. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership. url

It’s encouraging to see @POTUS Biden and @ClimateEnvoy Kerry re-establish America’s leading role on climate change. I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster. url

Yesterday's verdict was a step in the right direction. But one court ruling alone will not bring to an end the injustice and inequity that Black people experience daily.  I hope we will continue to make real progress on this.

“Time” is a poetic portrait of a family who love and support each other despite their difficult circumstances. I can’t recommend it highly enough. url

If “Time” wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley’s talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME url

Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it’s not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that. url

To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It’s encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year. url

Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody. Stephaun and his colleagues at @FredHutch are working to reach the people who are usually left behind. url

The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn’t count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.) url url

Cement is responsible for 6% of carbon emissions globally. To get to net-zero by 2050, we need innovations to decarbonize the material. I discuss a few approaches to make low-emission cement in my climate book: url

It's encouraging to see innovation and clean energy investments at the forefront of @POTUS's #AmericanJobsPlan. Building markets for new energy technologies is good for jobs today and will build the economies we need while avoiding a climate disaster. url

Here are five things you should know if you want to understand how variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic. url

I named my book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” not “How to Stop Climate Change,” because our climate is already changing—and no one will be hurt more by climate change than the world’s poorest people. Here's how we can help them adapt. url

Congratulations @AndrewSteerWRI on this important role. I’m excited to see what you and the Earth Fund will achieve. Avoiding a climate disaster is going to take all of us, and I’m grateful for @JeffBezos’s leadership and partnership. url

Thank you @SalKhanAcademy for a great conversation about climate change and thanks to @BookPeople and @BlueWillowBooks for hosting the event. url

For decades, Australian researcher Ruth Bishop led global efforts to identify and combat rotavirus. Her life is a reminder of the importance of scientific research to uncover unknown pathogens and the power of vaccines to prevent suffering and save lives. url

Thank you @BarackObama for the kind words. Your leadership at the 2015 Paris climate conference helped prove that global cooperation on climate is possible and gives me hope that we can reach our goal of zero emissions. url

@EDFaction @Breakthrough Thank you for your partnership, @EDFAction, and for sharing what all of us can do to avoid a climate disaster.

Moving to a green economy is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. I’m optimistic we can do it, but need to make sure it benefits everyone—including those workers and communities who depend on the fossil fuels that we need to get rid of. url

We can’t avoid a climate disaster without corporate leaders making courageous decisions now. I hope to work with @VWGroup on building the markets for the clean technologies the world needs. Thank you for the kind words, Herbert. url

Delivering vaccines to those who need them most, no matter where they live or how much money they have, is the only way to end the pandemic and begin the recovery. This is an important milestone. url

@EU_H2020 @EIB @Breakthrough @BloomBiorenewa1 To get to net zero, we need innovation to replace fossil fuels in everyday products like plastics. @BloomBiorenewa1 is one of the many companies leading on this important work.

We're fortunate to have an Energy Secretary who's focused on creating high-quality jobs to build a clean energy economy. I look forward to working with @SecGranholm on clean tech innovation and deployment. url

Recent extreme weather events are a stark reminder that we’re already seeing the effects of climate change here at home and around the world. This type of observation system will help scientists monitor and predict future weather events. url

Thanks @kwelkernbc and @JCCAtlanta for a great conversation about how we can avoid a climate disaster. url

I’m looking forward to joining @andrewrsorkin to talk about climate change, our foundation’s work in response to the pandemic, and more. url

It’s encouraging to have @ClimateEnvoy John Kerry representing the U.S. to the world. Now that we've rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, it's going to take ambitious action from U.S. leaders and those around the globe to avoid a climate disaster. url
