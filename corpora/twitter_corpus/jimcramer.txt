There was a lot of money that came in to the SPACs and the meme names yesterday. That always helps the tone of the Nasdaq. They will be back today.

this is the only one that was at all civil. As usual most were about some horrendously negative comments about how i look or how i think or what i say.  Disgusting cesspool of people  who have taken over what used to be a nice place to chat. What a shame. https://t.co/WS2WgSYkWp

@SquawkCNBC , @AndrewRosSorkin last guest encouraging betting.. might as well be @BSSportsbook

@andrewrsorkin is so right.. we can't make it all a game

Many of the forecasters  i follow are saying we are at the peak of the economy. If that is the case then Jay Powell will be right..

Do you know i just blocked every person who tweeted at me last night? Not one wasn't an attack. How worthless has this place become? I always tried to read everyone but the blocking--mostly from Reddit WSB people--is too much of a time suck.

Periodically chill likes to point out the total morons i deal with including people like this mountebank who has no idea where i stand on the PRC...One watch of any of my 3500 shows would tell you. People just tweet any nonsense https://t.co/oIwZSsF5bH

Chill says here's a fellow that does not understand that unless you are vaccinated you fear giving it to older people. More important David Hall from Sanford, you succeeded. You made my Sunday start with a recognition of how vile social media can be...Congratulate yourself! https://t.co/L63RihOOt9

Actually Frank Del Rio has done the most to make it so the CDC should have no objections. At the same time he has the best balance sheet, did the best job raising money, and has done a phenomenal job trying pioneering safety...  It's not his fault! https://t.co/78zbN1omSz

One other thing, before i get to hug my daughter for the first time-thank you Moderna!--i want very much to stop being called a hedgie. I stopped being a manager 21 years ago. I also have zero close friends who are hedge fund managers. So enough!

thank you! I try so hard and try to give it all for my viewers but sometimes the truth hurts for those who use margin, calls or are all about GME and AMC and Palantir and what ever stock has a big short. They tire me but i am tireless in my blocking and i love it. It's so final! https://t.co/IbmQlKqBHD

Actually this is about new partnerships and 5 nano v. botched 7 nano. If you are making typewriters and the other guy is making p.c.s than capacity doesn't matter. I appreciate that you weren't angry or vicious in your tone like so many that i block. https://t.co/KiK9j0qkz2

Thank you! You are a beacon of kindness amid the viciousness of the people who now populate my mentions column. As usual the fools just want me to quit or retire but i will be in this biz long after they are blown out by margin and lack of knowledge https://t.co/nIGic2XoGX
