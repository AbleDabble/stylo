What is stream?! :o

@notlittleredlo @Obviouslywaffle I'LL HELP!

Don't... "worry about it publicly"

Welp.

@Obviouslywaffle Here lies Robin. He was a temporary and permanent resident of Canada.

Uh... ü§î

I moved not long ago! Let's recreate my place in Sims? In the meantime here's a selfie hashtag no filter https://t.co/cHY5fchQPG https://t.co/djqjJYCaf3

@stefsanjati Ah, too kind! Thank you! Just saw the notification as I raided hah, feeling's mutual, love the atmosphere you're rocking in the streams! Have a good one! &lt;3

I make joke! #originaljoke https://t.co/vDPGXAbgUC

@Brain_error I wanted to go private, but apparently that's not even an option. Even if I had a million dollars, I couldn't pay for treatment. Private clinics aren't even legally allowed to prescribe hormones, in Sweden. But I'm looking in to other countries...

@Academi18 It's pretty crazy, and that's AFTER having gotten the diagnosis of gender dysphoria already. I'm gonna be almost 40 by the time I'm through it all, unless I can find some other path... Worrying, considering I'm not exactly the only one in this position!

Put together, counting the current wait times in Sweden, for the various stages of evaluation, hormones, etc... The process, from getting a referral to a gender specialist to post-op is looking to take about 8 years. With no alternative route. It's a pretty sad state...

Just finished Genesis Noir, and dang! Really unique and super creative game, and if you have about 5 hours and some love for abstract art and jazz music, play it! Good times! https://t.co/MqTSZeONFM

How do you feel about doing some crimes! Wait. No. My lawyers tell me it's solving crime. Wanna SOLVE crime? https://t.co/cHY5fchQPG

@Obviouslywaffle Super Moist Bros... https://t.co/GdTM9ZsOac

@TroyBakerVA Red Moist Redemption?

@Girbeagly @ColourPopCo Yeah, I've heard that as well, about their customer service. It's a shame because I don't like putting companies "on blast" publicly over something just affecting myself, since everyone's allowed to make mistakes, but... With no response, what's one to do.

Hey, @ColourPopCo u up? I spent about $250 on your Animal Crossing make-up which, upon eventual arrival at Swedish customs got denied and sent back due to missing declaration of contents/value. I contacted your "reply within 48h" customer support a week ago... Lost your password?

@Jack_Septic_Eye I can't believe you're never gonna use a computer again, man, what a wild time we live in!

@Jack_Septic_Eye RIGHT?! WHAT ARE THEY EVEN GOOD FOR

Happy Easter, y'all! Regardless of whether you celebrate or not, at least we can all join in and enjoy this gif of a bunny that swallowed a man :) https://t.co/W7XUdBJx82

@Chetreo Agreed, and kinda the same goes for streaming? If a channel I only watch on occasion tend to stream a lot, they get shoved to the top of the feed every time they're live, and it makes me more likely to unsub because it takes up space... Should be a "live" tab...

And now, at last, 4 months later my referral is in... And now there's a ca. 20 MONTH waiting period. To START treatment. It's a tough hill to climb, and I've barely started. But who knows, maybe it'll snowball! Regardless, it's gonna be worth it :)

Because that's silly, even without a pandemic, I sent them a PDF which they forwarded to the clinic for gender reassignment. The referral bounced, because it was sent by GP and not psych. So I had to hound psych to send it in, to which they asked me for the address. Twice.

In Nov of 2020 my GP referred me to a psychiatric specialist and on Feb 10th I met with them for eval. I received the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and was told to contact my GP again. My GP hadn't gotten any results and suggested I print my copy out, and come into town with it.

Since #TransDayOfVisibility is going on, I thought I'd share a bit of my own experience with the medical field so far. People often talk about various parts of the process being difficult, but less so about even getting to that point. A thread.

The Wind Waker train is rolling! You'd think a "setting sail" metaphor would of be more appropriate, but... That's the kind of wild and wacky adventure this is! https://t.co/cHY5fchQPG https://t.co/GJ3p2KiBhC

In unrelated news, here is a picture of a completely normal man with a normal, real face, which is completely normal thanks, bye! https://t.co/nLeYJMiyte

@Pyrepaw TOO SHINY FOR TWITCH!

@JEANINE2127 The age of butt... Comes to a close...

@BADC0mpany69 That's what I find the most weird yeah, they had it approved for literally a year and a half, but suddenly it's too much :P ... Oh well!

It was a good like 1,5 years but... RIP butt! :c https://t.co/v27WQIwZMH

Eggs.

@GabSmolders ‚ùóÔ∏èyou've been spotted! https://t.co/EEeetSbdBl

I took a picture in Spider-Man Miles Morales, and I thought it came out really nice, so now I'm Tweeting it. Bye! https://t.co/blmPvD4cR4

@Obviouslywaffle @Jack_Septic_Eye You're putting too much animation in your animation! IRIS! STOP ANIMATING! (I mean don't actually because I wanna see more but you know) IT'S SO MUCH! :O

There was a huge ass at the office today so I took the boys to my fav hang spot instead :))) https://t.co/ix7HkOKdRM

I drew some lil "transition-themed" sub-badges for streams :) https://t.co/ZP75JmRVCA

@lovexombie Sorry, I was making pancakes and misread the recipe as "1 hour" but it really said egg :(

@Girbeagly The installation of Premiere 2021 also killed my old 2018 install, and 2020/2021 are literally 10x slower on my system, for some magic reason... üôÉ

@royal_kingbird1 Go for it! I put highres versions on my Flickr :) https://t.co/cUcs2JXMzG

I like videogames, but I also like taking pictures in videogames. Spiderman Remaster added the ability to place up to 3 custom lights in a scene for your photomodes... It's pretty dang neat c: https://t.co/s94PgItuCo

@Koodles1017 https://t.co/dzWCrh87VM

I'M ONTO YOU, DISNEY! (WandaVision spoilers kinda?) https://t.co/XKgb3xVOTE

I made a video where I talk about Transition version alpha 0.0.0.1! So far... so messy... https://t.co/tg3JAYbKO8

@CrankGameplays Q! W! C! V! Ease in! Ease out! EASE OUT!!! FingerPower Activated!

@lovexombie DID YOU TATTLE ON ME!? meanie bo-beanie ü•∫

My Twitter account was just locked due to a DMCA claim and I had to go through some confirmation process. On a clip I posted in 2016... of an animation I did in like 2007... that had a part of a Beastie Boys song in it. THAT WAS SCARY! Are you ok?

Happy International Women's Day, folks! (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*‚ú≤Ôæü*ÔΩ°‚ãÜ

WAIT. You take the concept of Slime Rancher. You make it look and play like Stardew Valley. BUT IT'S POK√âMON. You make a billion dollars, you're welcome, Reggie.

@mohib2204 @elgato That's... pretty hot... I'm still trying to convince myself to buy 2 keylights, but now I want more things dangit :P

@lovexombie WAIT THERE'S WORMS AND SPACE JELLIES NOW?!

March the 4th be with you :)

I don't feel sick so I'm gonna stream hehehehe, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! cubicEvil

@Chetreo I ordered, and paid for, mine on the same day Sony officially announced prices back in like September... Still haven't received it...

@fake_gamergirl8 It's a worrying combo of being exhausted despite having slept almost all day, that pre-fevery type feeling, and a sore throat :/ ... But at least I got noodle soup!

Hello lovely humans, it's me again! No stream tonight though, I'm not feeling too good, not sure why but I need to rest for now :( https://t.co/FdoRBg2nNg

@Girbeagly @CrankGameplays @Adobe Right?! It's the weirdest paradox...

Estimated export-time for a ~2 hour stream:

Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2020: 8+ hours (5% CPU)
Adobe Media Encoder CC 2020: 8+ hours (5% CPU)
Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018: ~1 hour (95-100% CPU)

Same files, same project, same hardware.
Thanks, @Adobe üôÉ

Mama b-day is over, let's play games! https://t.co/cHY5fchQPG
