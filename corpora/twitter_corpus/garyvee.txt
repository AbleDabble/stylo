@day25 Hahahahah

@martintomoya You’re doing everything right

@JaymesWestfall @TheEllenShow @ChubbiesNFT @joinClubhouse @0xPolygon Will check it and massive love back my guy ❤️♥️

@JaymesWestfall @TheEllenShow @ChubbiesNFT I don’t plan to know answers I’m a human .. I am focused on my project that I understand is all I’m saying my friend

@JaymesWestfall @TheEllenShow The world is large, the way NFT’s are structured all of these projects would be coming if I was alive or not, it’s enviable. Human nature, supply and demand will be an issue for a time.

@JaymesWestfall @TheEllenShow Jaymes I promise what I am doing won’t be looked at as “hurt” Ellen very likely didn’t see my project and 99.99999% of the other people with communities are doing things regardless of me

@AmiteshNarkar Yes

@CMYKrypto Of course not.. but I’m confident

@infinityhodl A lot

Working on it as we speak ... Nov/Dec ..
I’ve been busy this year https://t.co/VUdGQyiMbz

@Prymzx Sure

I agree there’s a lot of poor projects .. it’s why I am motivated .. I want to create a blueprint that others can follow to bring wayyyyy more value to their audience and community and build long term ❤️♥️💙 https://t.co/ifocFY8OFy

@Rockurstocksoff @punk_zk @LedgerVince I’m not sure on trust yet to be honest .. MetaMask is firm firm ... working on others

@punk_zk @Rockurstocksoff @LedgerVince Working on all custodial but already know MetaMask is locked and loaded and a lot of first timers I think can really use the help of simplicity

@Mike13885096 @viperfishing But I’ll have free opportunities

@djiggie_onetime Harsh ... but clever as fuck ...

@NFTupdate Done
