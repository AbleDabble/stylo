@MattiSchroder @heyblake Thank you Matti! 🙌🏼

@Nightmare_D3mon @ashnichrist @HarrisHeller Thank you so much for the shout out!

@Thomas_Capone Thanks, liking it already because on their website they say, "These boxes are crack for their Instagram feed." 🤣

@natebattistone @LennoxSessi Thanks Nate - I appreciate that!

Can anyone recommend any "video brochure" companies they've worked with? The ones where you open the brochure, or a box, and then a video plays?

@OblixPC I use a card saver in the bag to keep it stiff, but I just put the pack in front of it, not in the cardsaver

@npg1989 Whoa. https://t.co/C0ADpyuty4

Our entire family, kids included, has been binge watching The Brady Bunch. First time I’ve really watched it.

It’s so great!

Today I learned about George Glass. 🤣

Also, Mike bring an architect like I once was is pretty cool. 

And I can’t get the song out of my head. 😋

@its_jess_6 Congrats! Class of 2005 Alum with an architecture degree here. Go Bears!

Thank you @TechnoDad_ for the support! 🤟🏼🔥😃 https://t.co/owhkykZmAl

Are any YouTubers experiencing super long "checks running" after uploading a video and getting it ready for publication? 

Our last few videos have had checks that have been running several hours long before being able to publish after processing

@TeamYouTube Well, he doesn't have twitter which is why he asked me to send the message through. Other means of reaching you beyond Twitter?

@maikaisogawa @copy_ai @heyblake I appreciate you Maika!

@ScottSpiker @PaulYacoubian @copy_ai I have. I was a California Golden Bear and went to the Ducks stadium during a football game in 2002. It was nuts.

@heyblake What can I do for your audience to make this the BEST use of a viewers time? The most memorable conversation?

@heyblake Let’s do this!

@MrAsquith @ApplePodcasts Hey Mark, we are having the same issues for Smart Passive Income. Hope all else is well on your end buddy, hoping this gets resolved soon.

@chanel808life @YouTubeCreators Nah this is someone who has all the qualifications but YouTube is now allowing him to do it for some reason.

@YouTubeCreators Asking for a friend (literally): he’s qualified for memberships on his channel based on subs and watch hours, but for some reason memberships are disabled. Any ideas?

RT @ParnesFernando: 7/

Couple of awesome events tomorrow! The first is happening at 10:00am PST, and is hosted by https://t.co/cJeU2edlog.…

@maxbranstetter 😭

Couldn’t recommend this upcoming webinar more with @ConvertKit and @samcartapp together talking about launching courses: https://t.co/Wx31w4ooPo

@adam_buchanan Haha!

@prestonedu1 Haha! 😭

When you’re having a business conversation on the phone, and then all of a sudden you hear an entire class of kids go “who is talking?” because your airpods automatically connected to the iPad your daughter was using for class. https://t.co/hipiN5CbMj

@ShavensThemaven Trueeeee.

@ItsLewdicolo Hehe, nah I'm not LDS, but support anyone who has wisdom such as this to share!

@PaulYacoubian @thisiswenzel A million percent yes. @CircleApp - love it so much I’m an advisor now 😅

@apetechda It’s interesting because I think many of us saw this coming, it makes sense, but it’s something no one was really asking for, or really wants.

@PaulYacoubian @thisiswenzel I’ve been promoting more of my own online courses and products, and that’s a majority of the income now.

Affiliate offers still perform well, but BH wasn’t best serving our audience and I’ve since started recommending others.

Webinars.

It took me 3 years to finally get confident with them &amp; now they're an integral part of my business!

@KingSkullDerek Thanks my man 👊🏼

@apetechda @PokeJohnTCG Haterade taste so good tho! 🤣 Thanjs back to you as well Alex, hope we can connect more formally sometime in the future! If there’s anything you need lemme know!

@dallasblack @AlexHodges @PokeJohnTCG In this case, I know a lot of people are watching, so they become learning moments, but just for me, but for everyone on the sidelines too. Been at this for over a decade now...always a fun learning experience!

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG I appreciate the respectful conversation, and much prefer the ask and then the conversation, versus the jump to “you are the problem but it’s mainly based on my own prejudice past and experience with others who have conditioned me to put all people like you in a bucket.” /rant

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG 5. I’m teaching people, content creators, and collectors who care, how to think smart about decisions around money making, and also how to actually run a business in a way where nice guys can win.

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG Of course I get special treatment, I have a checkmark! But there are bad people with check marks too, and I’m using that for good. Getting noticed, yes. Using it for good. Totally.

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG 4. I’m starting an anti-scalper movement, called Replacs, where communities of people will be acting out of kindness to give away more cards and product to people.

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG 3. I’ve personally reached out to help several existing and long time Pokémon content creators to help them better serve their own audiences...

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG 2. I’m using my content creation superpowers to share advice and tips I’m learning along the way, including mistakes I’ve personally made. Never offending to be the expert. Just sharing what I’ve recently learned...

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG Here’s a list:

1. I’ve given away $6000+ of Pokémon Product to people who can’t afford or get access to cards. (Goal is: $40k for 2021.

@616trent @PokeJohnTCG Buying packs on streams is for my own personal entertainment and collection goals. Legit that’s the last thing that relates to what I do for the hobby LOL. The last thing I’m looking to do is up my socials, and there are way smarter (and cheaper) ways to do that than buying packs

@killerdruid @PokeJohnTCG Aye thank you!! https://t.co/cF41KaxrXU

@dallasblack @PokeJohnTCG Nah I disagree, people aren’t defined or have less value due to their follower count. Some of my biggest fans are people with very little following. Worth my time because I can learn more about the psychology of who I’m speaking to. That’s value to me. 👊🏼

@PokeJohnTCG Hope to see you in and around the community in the future. 👊🏼

@PokeJohnTCG Bro. You’re stopping positivity by commenting in the moment like that. Don’t know what I did to offend you, but I’m sorry. I AM here to serve and add value. 

Imagine someone new trying their best who doesn’t have a thick skin getting a comment like that. THAT can ruin the hobby.

Hmm, so why’d you delete your comment @PokeJohnTCG? You said out loud I was ruining the hobby, what’s up with that? 🤷🏼‍♂️

@derraleves https://t.co/n15dePPwk2 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

@ParnesFernando As far as the recipe, unfortunately, it's in my mom's head, and not written down anywhere :( - I'm sure you could find some decent recipes on authentic Filipino Cuisine food blogs, however as we all know, every mom does it different and every mom's is the best.

@ParnesFernando This is definitely THE most important question. So sorry to hear about the local restaurant! Same thing happened here, too!

@jackbteaching @YouTube Thank you so much Dr. Jack!

@evanhecht Ayeeee 👊🏼
