Fun little clip from stream the other day!! Love random teammates 😄

Been a busy day! Already. Got called into work early. Now making some lunch after doing homework. And it’s not even noon!! 😂 It’s been good though tbh! url

Thank you all for an amazing stream. I hope everyone has a great weekend and I’ll see y’all on Monday!

Also!! Just a reminder that tonight is community night for DBD and I hope to  be able to play with y’all!

Hell yeah!! Got that assignment finished and submitted after like 3 days of working on it. Only 2 more assignments then I can enjoy my birthday weekend 😄

Was a busy day at work!! Gonna stream in about 15 minutes as well!! Hope to see y’all there!

That moment when you know you’ll probably get up but sleep is tempting 😄

That moment when you unlock a new character, but can’t play because it’s a popular character 😂 #VALORANT url

Made a couple of adjustments from my last version, but it’s definitely a lot better!! url

@1matree It’s a really good one!! I’ve only ever watched it though and haven’t played it myself 😅

Wooo!! Got a prototype of the new overlay up and going, and I’m really excited to see how it’ll look in game!

Mornin y’all!! Hope everyone is ready to have a fantastic Wednesday! 
Here’s a mountain pic to start it off! url

@1matree Ooooo!! I’ll definitely have to try and stop in because I love little nightmares!!😄

Hey Everyone!! So I just recently realized that I have not been doing my absolute best that I can for the stream. 
So. 
I’ll be making some changes soon such as: 
Posting here more often
Reworking my overlay 
And much more! 

I’m super excited and thank you all for the support!

OK. I’m officially addicted to Genshin. I’ll probably start streaming it from now on for a bit alongside DBD!

@nimikyu @DeadByBHVR THIS would be absolutely amazing if they did!. (Probably won’t but hey, we can dream)

I’m pretty proud of this one and wanted to share!! #StreamerCommunity #DeadbyDaylight #fallguys #Scrutinized #ResidentEvil3remake #twitchstreamer #twitchclips url

@1matree Hehehe. That was evil. But hysterical! Can’t wait to see those😅😂

@1matree ‘Twas a good night of crazy😂

‘Twas a long needed break. But we are back on Twitter!! I’ll be doing my best to get clips and the like uploaded here as well!!

Hey guys! I’m taking a small break from social media’s simply because I’m just tired of it all. I do have a discord and if you’re interested in joining please let me know!!

@realDonaldTrump Also. Has** not had 😅 my bad

@realDonaldTrump And this goes for discussing Covid or other potential government policies that people would like to put in place

@realDonaldTrump Oof rough tweet. I only say this BECAUSE we are comparing populations of less than 100 million people to a country that had 300+ million people. What I’m getting at is, what works for 5 or even 80 million people WONT work for 300+ million.

@1matree 😂😂😂

@1matree Hey uh tree. Good luck my dude😂

Hey y’all!! Just wanted to thank you guys all for getting me to affiliate today!! I’m super stoked to see just where things will go!!
