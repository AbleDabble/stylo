Dinner last night in Koreatown - @BbqJongro. Amazing. And with Korean BBQ you kindof feel like you had something to do with why it’s so delicious? (It’s really the ingredients.) Soooo good. #supportyourlocalrestaurants 🥢 url

My friend used to put Post-it Notes on his mirror for daily inspiration. His date came over one night and saw one that said, “Just be yourself, Kevin!” #WhyImSingle

It's Hashtags time! Tweet out a funny, weird, or embarrassing reason you're single and tag it with #WhyImSingle. Could be on the show!
