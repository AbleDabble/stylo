Have you met my character in AFK Arena yet? If you tap on him enough he might give you something special. Not really though. He just gets mad. I just want you to bother him for me. Download AFK Arena and bug him today:¬†https://t.co/kVLrVLwksd #ad https://t.co/Jw2mPIK49E

It's perfectly normal to make a fake movie trailer for a sponsorship right? ...right? Anyway, new trailer for @AFK_Arena that I made even though they asked me not to! https://t.co/LpNJTZ8FmF
