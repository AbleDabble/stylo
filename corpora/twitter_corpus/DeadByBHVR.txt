@Alexand95072236 @Xbox Back to 90%

@Fweeby133 How long they were actually chased: 30 seconds.

@Xbox ... Okay it's like 88%.

@kylie4815162342 I'd rather we keep track of the chapters we make and not lose months of work.

@ShotcallGG It's okay, we do it too.

@kisshoony 90% done is less about math and more about a mindset

It breaks when copying the emojis sometimes and I gotta' redo them. We'll fix this. 😭

@PtboJames81 @SMITEGame I realized immediately after this next move how badly I just messed up.

@SMITEGame A little, ngl. The whole community team is watching.
