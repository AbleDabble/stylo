We're journeying back to Vutoa for a new season of @MotherlandsRPG.

Starts today at 4pm PT at url. url

For getting involved:

Minnesota Freedom Fund via @MNFreedomFund url

List of organizations that are fighting for racial justice via @WeAreTiltify url

For mental health resources, and dealing with the trauma of police violence:

Healing in the Face of Cultural Trauma via @TheABPsi url

And Twitch Cares url

For further education resources in regards to race and policing, feel free to reference the following: 

Talking About Race via @NMAAHC url  

Who Polices the Police via @UBLibraries url

We ask that you continue to educate yourselves as to the history of police brutality in this country, and support those organizations and individuals who are doing the work of making America a better place for those who find themselves most often persecuted.

Death of Black people at the hands of police has been an ever present issue in American history. The events surrounding this recent trial are a grim reminder of how far we as a society still have to go for the basic humanity of others to be valued, and treated as sacred.
