Tomorrow! You can catch me back on my channel, tomorrow. 

I miss you guys ❤

I need tacos

-be someone’s comfort streamer

Okay, maybe not.. My cap card isn't capturing 

If I can't fix tonight, new one tomorrow🤔

@NmelessKing She stole my sleep url

Stream tomorrow?

Maybe🤔

@NmelessKing 10 years old 😁

@SpacePeepo Nope! I need to add a reminder 😅

@stoofii url

@maechael1916 😂

@Spooky_LunchBox 😂

Its seriously what I've been missing in my day 😅

@IndieInsom Bean juiceeeeee

@maechael1916 Tbh.. I need me a bang

@maechael1916 Thank you man. Its a rough time.. But I wouldn't be able to push through if it weren't for the great peeps around.

You are a kind dude :)

Yeeeeeeep url

I haven't had coffee in over a week.

Time to fix that ☕

@ThreatDesigns Thank you very much dude ❤

@maechael1916 Thanks dude. Very much appreciated

Today is the first day of my fathers new treatment. Very likely no stream today, I'm joining him at all his appointments 😈

Streams start back up tomorrow! Miss you all, sorry for the lack of streams lately.

Well.. One of two doses 😁

I got my vaccination 😏

@Sorceressscarem 😁😁

Happy birthday to the best girl, Ponyo 😺 url

Took tonight off. 
I'll be live again soon.

Have a great weekend!

I know I've been pretty spotty lately with streams. In short, I've received some discouraging news regarding my dad &amp; his cancer treatment. 

It's been a rough road, but I'm still holding onto hope things will improve.

Cancer sucks.

@Sorceressscarem 😼😁

@dodgerplaysTV You too dude!

@Upt0wn_J3ss She gets said babyface from yours truly 
😝

@xTomfoolery Shes getting up there for sure! 10 years though 😁

@maechael1916 I know right!

I haven't been too active lately.

Hope you all are getting on alright :)

One week until Ponyo's 10th 😌

Time sure does fly &lt;3 url

Since when is it April?!

@Upt0wn_J3ss url

Sometime in the past day or two, I ate something wrong &amp; I'm not feeling too great.

Hopefully I'll feel better before tonight pushes through.. but I'll let you all know.

Have a great rest of your day!

RT @BikeMan: Viewers that title their twitch clips are god tier to the streamer.  Just saying.

I've taken a week off from the gym.. Send me motivation!

...and tacos, that's what I really want.

@maechael1916 A bit too much, but it was definitely needed 😌

@maechael1916 Thanks man!

Had a short stream tonight, I'm wiped! I'll be back Wed/Thurs with a new game added. 

Nini Twitter!

@Upt0wn_J3ss I hope she helped😁

I'm going to be a little bit behind tonight! I'm just getting home from the gym &amp; still have to eat. I'll be about another hour before I'm set up and ready.

Valheim tonight! 

I'll see you there :)
