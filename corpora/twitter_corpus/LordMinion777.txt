@PurpleBolt71 There is nobody I‚Äôd freak out to meet like that haha

@LeonhartYT Sure lol. Is that all it takes to be a celebrity? We have the power to make anybody one!

@CriTEEGal Ohhh I could be like the frogman!

@Platonictrash Lol I‚Äôm not gonna be offended by any answer, I‚Äôm just genuinely curious

Not looking for compliments but I appreciate it lol, I don‚Äôt need to be one I‚Äôm just genuinely interested in how people view fame, etc and when people have ‚Äúmade it‚Äù or w/e

@flashback696 I like the phrase ‚Äútip potential‚Äù and I may steal it for future use

@SigrunDS Lol sometimes but it‚Äôs tough. No matter what schedule I keep I‚Äôm letting someone down

Curious on thoughts here creators, viewers, etc. What constitutes being a celebrity? Are you one or think you‚Äôre one? Am I one? I don‚Äôt  think of myself that way but I‚Äôm curious what everyone thinks about the term‚Äôs actual meaning.

@PlayKatiePlay Context matters I think though it still doesn‚Äôt look good lol

@najicakes Oh

wait that should point up. Hey Siri, how do I tweet pointing at myself

&lt;--- Comedic Genius

Apologies for my last tweet everyone. I hit send before I really thought about it. Shoulda put a little 'd' instead of a big 'D' but it's too late now, it's already out there.

@VikingPandawan Yeah, and I force people to follow me to be annoyed by my ramblings. Fills me with joy :D

@TheGreatDabdos no, I'm trying to get canceled for this. IT'S MY ONLY GOAL, THIS IS MY LEGACY

@graybea89766559 invite friends and family to watch to boost numbers early, do it for fun not for $ as that's hard to make for a long time, and be yourself and have fun. Appreciate your viewers no matter how many there are and talk to them.
