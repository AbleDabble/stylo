@Valkyrae @bigbossboze @LudwigAhgren Great getting to talk today! Way to represent for Table #1 in those final games.

P.S. Little Ollie says "hi!"

May not have walked away with $100,000, but got to hang out with these wonderful people...so who's the REAL winner?

Still not me... https://t.co/plhpmhJilc

@LudwigAhgren @CashApp Not smart enough to get into round 2 😭

Today in content you didn't know you needed:

Me and @KarlJacobs_ arm wrestling https://t.co/u8qT5dXvFp

@SinisterPhoenix I'm so glad we've been positive in your life. Honestly, the Theorist community has helped get me through some of the darkest parts in my life, too, so you're certainly not alone!

@nouralshaikh1_ Biology IS the hard part in life, I know!

@Phoenix_137 You're telling me! It's weird to think it's been a third of my life!?!

@Weswells6 Midwest nerd pride! 🤓

Ten years ago I made a video hoping it would help me find a job.
Instead, it found me so much more...
A voice, a community, acceptance, a chance to make a difference. 

Thank you for welcoming this Ohio nerd into your life for the last decade. 
Onward to the next ten! https://t.co/umF8HfmAix

@Spiral_Dominion @creatorinkhq Absolutely! It'll probably be a few days as they rework things, but keep an eye out.

As such, please know that I am personally ensuring that changes are being made to @CreatorINKHQ's design process that ensure this does not happen again. 

Thank you to everyone who brought this to my attention. I'm really upset this happened but I'm working to make it right.

Improper use of artwork is something we've historically struggled with and have worked hard to stop on the channels, so it's frustrating that a company we work with would think this is acceptable even after I've specifically warned them against copying any artwork in the past.

1. STOP production: no shirts with inappropriate designs have/will be printed
2. The design is now being updated to remove ALL unfair use of IP/fan-created imagery 
3. Artists will be compensated for the original design
4. Anyone who ordered will have a chance to cancel

Just been made aware of issues with the design made and approved by @CreatorInkHQ for our 10th Anniversary Merch. As a result, I have ensured they do ALL of the following...

@HeroTechne @creatorinkhq Followed. I'll send a DM once I've had my call. Again, I am so sorry and VERY upset that, after all the work our team has done to avoid situations like this, that one of our partners would be so careless. 

I was told everything was fair for us to use. Clearly that was a mistake.

@HeroTechne Just seeing this. Currently stuck in meetings but am hopping on an IMMEDIATE call this afternoon with @creatorinkhq to see how it happened/find a solution. 

This obviously is a huge mistake. I'm sorry for any stress it's caused you. FWIW: I'm furious and changes will be made.

Pro-tip: If you set the bar low enough, you have nowhere to go but up.

Can you BEAT my bandicoot score? No. No you cannot.

 At this point I'm getting more steps in #CrashOnTheRun than I am in real life.

Download the game and show me your best!

Your work ROCKS! (ba doom ching...I hate myself)

Seriously, thank YOU for working with us on the episode. The real Glamrock Chica has A LOT to live up to when Security Breach releases. No pressure Scott 😜 https://t.co/YG1eI3axa5

Ready for some new Bandicoot action?

Get your best marsupial mating calls ready because Steph and I are playing the new #CrashOnTheRun game!

In other news, I learned that I ROCK a red surgical hairnet. Future merch, perhaps? https://t.co/FoUC1qWmXT

I got honest...maybe too(?) honest...with @verge about what it means to survive 10 years on YouTube. We chat everything from #DreamSMP to upcoming projects for the channels!

What do you think? Do you agree?

@SquillisPMcWill @CordyPatrick This made my day! He's a theorist after my own heart. 
Tell him good luck on his Luigi's Mansion playthrough ;)

But hey, that's just a tweet. A tweet for your son. Thanks for reading.

@Defunctland Feel this. This 8k/360 that we did took a week to upload. A WEEK. https://t.co/DM34Ln8FQ1

Oh baby. Woof. https://t.co/p6omhJuGaH

This will be in my 2021 Calendar. https://t.co/3io4cDPDey

Stephanie almost dumped me for this one... https://t.co/On2aBBrZ9n

With pics like these, who needs an OnlyFans? https://t.co/0WByELByTZ

Saw that I'm trending.
Guys...you haven't even scratched the surface. https://t.co/N6u6qRZTY4

@hankgreen oh my Hank is it warm in here?

One of my life goals has been to be a perpetual student. I'm so excited (and a little nervous...) to have @MarkRober as my newest teacher.

...Also sorry Mark I'm a day behind and this is the first time in my life I've ever had overdue homework so I'm kind of freaking out. https://t.co/zn9FAe4tMe

@KarlJacobs_ HUGS AND KISSES KARL!

@KarlJacobs_ @Preston Dare you to tell that to @MrBeastYT next time he does 24 hours in ice.

@MichelleKhare @belmoon01 @somegoodnews Just finished watching it. SO GOOD! 
My musical theater heart nearly burst with happiness.

This feels like a lifetime ago https://t.co/mH8V2L8xEm

@KarlJacobs_ You know what's NOT a theory?
Your house is TOO DAMN COLD! 🥶🥶🥶

@MrBeastYT @Quackity @KarlJacobs_ Watch out @KarlJacobs_ , @Quackity and I are gunning for your spot in the Beast Crew...and that's NOT a theory 😉

@quackity4k I'll never let go, Quackity. 
I'll never let go.

I know it's been a week, but I am STILL digging out of all the emails and catching up. I may be behind the times but I'm 100% not over it. Thank you all so much.

This. This is what it was all for. https://t.co/c2Ei6GCr7N

Thanks @PhillyD for the super positive coverage of our charity stream: https://t.co/lSi5u4ff7T

(Too bad old school media outlets aren't brave enough to follow your example &amp; print positive YouTuber news 😉.)

PS: THANK YOU for your incredibly generous donation!

A HUGE thank you to @statefarm and @jakestatefarm for contributing $250,000 to @stjude during our livestream yesterday. 

Great things truly do happen when “Good Neighbors” come together. 😉

(Also...totally having a bromance with Jake now) https://t.co/b9EBSwnMF7

An extra special thank you to @SusanWojcicki and @YouTube for the surprise donation of $450,000 during our #StJude stream. Incredible!

Thank you for having a platform where communities can unite to have their voices heard and make a positive difference. https://t.co/EO8DioONjU
