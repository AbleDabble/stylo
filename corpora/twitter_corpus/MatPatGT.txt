@Valkyrae @bigbossboze @LudwigAhgren Great getting to talk today! Way to represent for Table #1 in those final games.

P.S. Little Ollie says "hi!"

May not have walked away with $100,000, but got to hang out with these wonderful people...so who's the REAL winner?

Still not me... url

@LudwigAhgren @CashApp Not smart enough to get into round 2 ðŸ˜­

Today in content you didn't know you needed:

Me and @KarlJacobs_ arm wrestling url

I'm playing Uno against @Valkyrae, @KarlJacobs_ and @LudwigAhgren for a chance to win $100,000 in Bitcoin...and you can win too! 

Check out url to watch the game and learn how you can win your share of the prize!

@SinisterPhoenix I'm so glad we've been positive in your life. Honestly, the Theorist community has helped get me through some of the darkest parts in my life, too, so you're certainly not alone!

@nouralshaikh1_ Biology IS the hard part in life, I know!

@Phoenix_137 You're telling me! It's weird to think it's been a third of my life!?!

@Weswells6 Midwest nerd pride! ðŸ¤“

Ten years ago I made a video hoping it would help me find a job.
Instead, it found me so much more...
A voice, a community, acceptance, a chance to make a difference. 

Thank you for welcoming this Ohio nerd into your life for the last decade. 
Onward to the next ten! url

@Spiral_Dominion @creatorinkhq Absolutely! It'll probably be a few days as they rework things, but keep an eye out.

As such, please know that I am personally ensuring that changes are being made to @CreatorINKHQ's design process that ensure this does not happen again. 

Thank you to everyone who brought this to my attention. I'm really upset this happened but I'm working to make it right.

Improper use of artwork is something we've historically struggled with and have worked hard to stop on the channels, so it's frustrating that a company we work with would think this is acceptable even after I've specifically warned them against copying any artwork in the past.

1. STOP production: no shirts with inappropriate designs have/will be printed
2. The design is now being updated to remove ALL unfair use of IP/fan-created imagery 
3. Artists will be compensated for the original design
4. Anyone who ordered will have a chance to cancel

Just been made aware of issues with the design made and approved by @CreatorInkHQ for our 10th Anniversary Merch. As a result, I have ensured they do ALL of the following...

@HeroTechne @creatorinkhq Followed. I'll send a DM once I've had my call. Again, I am so sorry and VERY upset that, after all the work our team has done to avoid situations like this, that one of our partners would be so careless. 

I was told everything was fair for us to use. Clearly that was a mistake.

@HeroTechne Just seeing this. Currently stuck in meetings but am hopping on an IMMEDIATE call this afternoon with @creatorinkhq to see how it happened/find a solution. 

This obviously is a huge mistake. I'm sorry for any stress it's caused you. FWIW: I'm furious and changes will be made.

Pro-tip: If you set the bar low enough, you have nowhere to go but up.

Can you BEAT my bandicoot score? No. No you cannot.

 At this point I'm getting more steps in #CrashOnTheRun than I am in real life.

Download the game and show me your best!

Seriously, thank YOU for working with us on the episode. The real Glamrock Chica has A LOT to live up to when Security Breach releases. No pressure Scott ðŸ˜œ url

Ready for some new Bandicoot action?

Get your best marsupial mating calls ready because Steph and I are playing the new #CrashOnTheRun game!

In other news, I learned that I ROCK a red surgical hairnet. Future merch, perhaps? url

I got honest...maybe too(?) honest...with @verge about what it means to survive 10 years on YouTube. We chat everything from #DreamSMP to upcoming projects for the channels!

What do you think? Do you agree?

@SquillisPMcWill @CordyPatrick This made my day! He's a theorist after my own heart. 
Tell him good luck on his Luigi's Mansion playthrough ;)

But hey, that's just a tweet. A tweet for your son. Thanks for reading.

@Defunctland Feel this. This 8k/360 that we did took a week to upload. A WEEK. url

Oh baby. Woof. url

This will be in my 2021 Calendar. url

Stephanie almost dumped me for this one... url

With pics like these, who needs an OnlyFans? url

Saw that I'm trending.
Guys...you haven't even scratched the surface. url

@hankgreen oh my Hank is it warm in here?

One of my life goals has been to be a perpetual student. I'm so excited (and a little nervous...) to have @MarkRober as my newest teacher.

...Also sorry Mark I'm a day behind and this is the first time in my life I've ever had overdue homework so I'm kind of freaking out. url

@KarlJacobs_ HUGS AND KISSES KARL!

WE MADE IT!!!!!

2020 in one video url

One of the last big charity streams of the year by a great guy! Go go go! url

@tryguys Congratulations on a great show! Thanks for giving YouTubers such a good name.

Congratulations #thankmas on blowing away your goal! There's still plenty of time to donate, so go over there and end 2020 on the best note possible: by helping someone else. url

Appear on my livestream, win your @streamys category? 

But hey, that's just a...

...testament to the hard work and dedication of all these people. Congratulations ;) url

@dreamwastaken2 Well deserved!
From one green boi to another, CONGRATS! 
ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š
