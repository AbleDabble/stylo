Equities popped during Fed press conference but reversed &amp; ended day lower; Energy decisively favored while Tech sold off relative to other sectors; everything else quite muted … large-cap growth hurt (given Tech’s weakness) &amp; still quite muted since mid-Feb url

Largest U.S. goods trade deficit ever reached in March at $90.6 billion vs. $88 billion est. &amp; $87.1 billion in prior month; imports +6.8% &amp; exports +8.7% … looks like we’re still buying many things from overseas url

Significant boost (to say least) in household savings throughout world @SoberLook @OECD @Refinitiv @FT url

Job postings on @indeed overall look healthy relative to before pandemic, but internship postings are still lagging behind @SoberLook url

Perhaps unsurprising given pandemic, but only 62.7% of high school graduates in class of 2020 were enrolled in colleges or universities, smallest share since 2001 &amp; down from 66.2% in 2019 @BLS_gov @Bloomberg url

U.S. population grew by only 7.4% over past decade, smallest increase since 1930s @uscensusbureau @nytimes url

Not a perfect relationship but cyclical sectors have generally done well relative to defensives when financial conditions are easier … though in past couple months, defensives have found a bid while financial conditions have continued to loosen to easiest on record url

Call option buys have rolled over since Feb/Mar to lowest since Nov (20d avg shown), coinciding with relaxing of some speculative trades…most-shorted stocks have gone nowhere &amp; non-profitable tech stocks still in bear market

Risk-on day with most cyclicals doing quite well &amp; outperforming defensives; yet, some in latter group (e.g., REITs) doing well over past few months &amp; catching up to cyclical strength … sector bias today makes sense with value outperforming (which has been case since mid-Feb) url
