S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index +12% y/y in Feb vs. +11.2% in prior month; prices climbed most since 2006, with low rates still boosting buying power https://t.co/kzS4XR16rO

More than 95% of S&amp;P 500 stocks still trading above their respective 200d moving averages … now at 17 consecutive days above 95% (longest ever) ... broader 50d &amp; 200d breath charts to right https://t.co/1bsCQXy4gp

Power of forward P/E during earnings accelerations: still an incredibly wide gap between S&amp;P 500’s forward P/E (blue) &amp; trailing 12M P/E (orange) … latter likely to come down as earnings growth improves https://t.co/CPJqYo5jz3

Vaccine sentiment for most part among those on FinTwit has been quite elevated, but perma-bulls feeling less positive of late @DataArbor @Twitter https://t.co/SwvkKsWBFq

Not much love for small caps lately … hedge fund shorts for Russell 2000 futures back near April 2020 levels https://t.co/QnU714rWsJ

Swift reversal from yesterday’s weakness with cyclicals out in front today; Tech &amp; Cons Discr did well, too, while defensives softer (Utilities &amp; Cons Staples negative) … small caps had nice rebound with value in lead, though large-cap value now in first since mid-Feb https://t.co/pzuaeqBGiY

Solid rebound in March new home sales, +20.7% vs. +14.2% est. &amp; -16.2% in prior month; level has now retaken January high and is at highest since 2006 … median price +0.8% y/y to $330,800; average selling price at $397,800 … months’ supply fell to 3.6 vs. 4.4 prior https://t.co/G7kEtPGO99

Median selling price for existing home in U.S. has spiked to record high of $329,100 (+17.2% y/y); meanwhile, inventory incredibly low with only 1.07 million homes for sale last month (-28% y/y) … at current pace, it would take 2.1 months to sell all homes on market https://t.co/OJI5KSGA4Y

Virtually no relationship between changes in capital gains tax rate &amp; S&amp;P 500 returns in year of change ... last time cap gains went up (in 2013), S&amp;P 500 had stellar year (up 30%)

Existing home sales continued to weaken in March, -3.7% vs. -1.8% est. &amp; -6.3% in prior month (rev up); overall level not weak relative to history but near lowest since last August…lack of inventory still an issue, but demand still looking robust given favorable borrowing costs https://t.co/Hal8fwXaJ2
