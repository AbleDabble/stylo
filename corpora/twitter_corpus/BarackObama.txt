Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. It’s important to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but this is also a reminder of just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country. https://t.co/sgcbRjlApr

Through his extraordinary example, His Royal Highness Prince Philip proved that true partnership has room for both ambition and selflessness — all in service of something greater. Our thoughts are with Her Majesty the Queen, the Royal Family, and the British people. https://t.co/qbH2ycbcaA

The only way we’ll be able to beat this pandemic is if enough people get vaccinated. So join me, Michelle, and Americans everywhere in getting the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it’s available to you—and encourage your friends and family to do the same. https://t.co/HSjb2DUl4u https://t.co/4CT0fyRHou

Bruce @Springsteen and I close out our podcast, Renegades: Born in the USA, back where it all began: with a conversation about the story of America and how to restore faith in its promise. Listen to our final episode on Spotify. https://t.co/KWmDc2YBLv https://t.co/NkNHRvbwwi

Read about other developments from communities working together to reimagine policing in our recent @MBK_Alliance report. https://t.co/kLBjeG9iPQ

More places are experimenting with programs that send civilian responders instead of police to help people experiencing mental health crises. It’s a promising development in law enforcement in the wake of this summer’s protests. https://t.co/kMj3pTp0pU

This Easter, I hope we can all take some time to reflect on the blessings we enjoy and the hope we have for a brighter future. From our family to yours, have a safe and happy Easter. https://t.co/hbTao0fIWd

Congratulations to @MLB for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens. There’s no better way for America’s pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.

It’s always great catching up with @IsabelWilkerson, and this time we’re talking about A Promised Land and our mutual love of books with @BNBuzz. Take a look: https://t.co/BFvUyPMYo2

Bruce and I agree that our most important anchor over the years has been our families. We’re both lucky enough to have remarkable partners who ground us, and kids who help us understand what really matters in life. Listen to our conversation on @Spotify: https://t.co/Tdl0izWsup https://t.co/72IDp72Vn5

My family and I are mourning the loss of our beloved grandmother, Sarah Ogwel Onyango Obama, affectionately known to many as “Mama Sarah” but known to us as “Dani” or Granny. We will miss her dearly, but we’ll celebrate with gratitude her long and remarkable life. https://t.co/avDY4f1PVu

As we build the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago, we're focused on generating sustainable jobs for the local community. Our new workforce initiative will open doors to those often left out of the construction industry. https://t.co/D5fAHFMdit

Let’s be clear: This is a deliberate attempt to undermine our democracy by making it harder to vote. That’s why passing the For the People Act is so important, and why every one of us needs to keep up the fight. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/YwBib0JYZw

Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do—and I’m grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight.

The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans.

And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious.

But I’ve always said that the ACA is like a starter home—it’s our job to keep tinkering with it and improving it over time.

The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage—and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.

As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It’s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. https://t.co/G7WUgYdxOp

A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. https://t.co/7MEJ87Is3E

Join me, @ProtectOurCare, and health care advocates from across the country to discuss 11 years of the Affordable Care Act and the work we still need to do to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. Watch now: https://t.co/Rae2yr8EjZ

Bruce @Springsteen and I both had complicated relationships with our fathers. In our latest conversation on Renegades: Born in the USA, we discuss our upbringing, masculinity, and the role our fathers played in helping us become the men we are today. https://t.co/FNriJIUw3r https://t.co/tqGXS6SzMj

11 years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it’s getting even better. I’ll be having a conversation with @ProtectOurCare this Monday, March 22 at 1:15 PM ET and hope you’ll join: https://t.co/SpbyOP81Ky

.@POTUS set a goal to deliver 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. His administration hit the milestone in just 58. Let’s keep it going: Please get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It’s the only way to beat this pandemic. https://t.co/uYmwRMMmYw

Like many of you, I’m thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here: https://t.co/S5mlQofvAp https://t.co/xyePa9ux2y

Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings—and we urge meaningful action that will save lives.

Yesterday's shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society.

Even as we’ve battled the pandemic, we’ve continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America. Although the shooter’s motive is not yet clear, the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end.

Congrats to directors @NicoleNewnham, @JimLeBrecht, and everyone with @CripCampFilm on the Oscar nomination! The heart, passion, and brilliance of those who led the disability rights movement is something to celebrate. Michelle and I hope you'll watch their story on Netflix.

I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land. One of the reasons I wrote this book was for young people to be able to see themselves in my story—and I hope our conversation left them as inspired as it left me. https://t.co/Aov53IvX6l

For the latest episode of our podcast, I talk to Bruce @Springsteen about my time as a community organizer and the influences that led to me pursuing a career in public service. Take a listen on Spotify: https://t.co/pxARdCUpFO https://t.co/l67AZEFuC5

When @POTUS was elected, he said help was on the way—and he delivered. The American Rescue Plan is landmark legislation that will ring through generations, lifting up families and beating back this pandemic. 
 
Here's how it will help people like you: https://t.co/EabnMBoXhy

Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it’s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again. So I hope you’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It could save your life. https://t.co/OJLwZbv0iz

From my first cross-country road trip as a child to Bruce’s experience coming of age toward the end of the Vietnam War, @Springsteen and I each continue to reflect on moments from our upbringing that helped shape our view of America. Listen here: https://t.co/3vQxU2zQub https://t.co/BPwubQuBcv

Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that’s why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. https://t.co/0ac3aWgCY0

This is the kind of progress that’s possible when we elect leaders across government who are devoted to making people’s lives better—and a reminder of why it’s so important to vote.

This landmark legislation will help families pay rent and put food on the table, lift millions of children out of poverty, make health care more affordable, aid small businesses, fund broad-based vaccination efforts, and make it easier for states to reopen schools.

Elections matter—and we’re seeing why. Congratulations to the Biden Administration and to the American people on a COVID relief bill that will improve the lives of families across the country.

.@BillGates' new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. He's unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met—and provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. https://t.co/Ukms2M9iK5

And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it’s always worth analyzing those successes in depth—and looking at where we came up short—as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering: https://t.co/c75VpLwkgD

The Biden administration’s commitment to democratic values at home and abroad couldn’t be more important—because democracy remains at risk around the world: https://t.co/hjDcY6ZtOv

If you haven’t read Michelle’s memoir yet, I hope you do—especially if the young readers’ edition might resonate with you or someone you know. Becoming isn’t just a title—it’s a process we all go through, and Miche’s story brings that to life with real honesty and beauty. https://t.co/bO8Y0Kkelz

Like so many others, Michelle and I benefited from Vernon Jordan's wise counsel and warm friendship—and deeply admired his tireless fight for civil rights. We hope the memory of his extraordinary presence and the legacy of his work bring comfort to Ann, Vickee, and his family. https://t.co/HBZfGUuyVl

RT @springsteen: In Episode 3 of Renegades: Born in the USA, Bruce and @BarackObama talk about identity, grace, and some of the songs that…

Music has always been an important part of my life, and I think it’s safe to say that the same is true for @Springsteen. In this episode, we talked about the songs that’ve made a difference for us—and Bruce even brought out the guitar. Listen on @Spotify: https://t.co/pUlY5kGQnZ https://t.co/vhMRZMgpnE

To date, My Brother’s Keeper has touched thousands of lives, and these are just a few stories of the inspiring young men we’ve met. By joining the @MBK_Alliance, you can help us reach even more. https://t.co/ol1G5LLZ8n

Today marks seven years since we launched My Brother’s Keeper to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. And it remains true that the only way our country lives up to its ideals is if our young people can reach their fullest potential. https://t.co/dOoOGPxnNv

I first picked up Toni Morrison’s novels when I was entering college, and her voice fundamentally changed my perspective on the world. This Black History Month, I reflected on the impact that her writing has had on my life. https://t.co/zSLkfkHmET https://t.co/W6Yn1YYaSF

It was great to hear from this impressive group of young leaders. If there's one thing we can bank on, it’s that young folks like these are our best hope for a more sustainable and just world. https://t.co/r3hzsgwgg3

In each of us, there's a story to be shared—a story that’s sacred and can bring us together. I had such a good time talking with the @WellReadBlkGirl Book Club about A Promised Land because just as they learned about my story, I had a chance to learn from theirs. https://t.co/u6vAXUSK5s

Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it’s important to recognize that there’s another pandemic raging right now—one that’s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve. https://t.co/3nD7uc194V

Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight—here’s to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf. If we’ve learned anything over the years, it’s to never count Tiger out.

Last year, I sat down with my good friend Bruce @Springsteen for a long and meaningful conversation that touched on so much of what we’re all dealing with these days. I’m excited to share it with you over the next few weeks: https://t.co/sQACD08AWx https://t.co/biMoxCLhAG

For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities.

I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from—a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. https://t.co/yIaNJpRq7M

Congrats to @NASAJPL on landing @MarsPersevere today! Looking forward to seeing what this mission uncovers—and proud our administration invested in this effort eight years ago to help continue America’s rich tradition of exploration and discovery.

I felt inspired and hopeful after speaking with students in @TheTellingRoom’s Young Writers &amp; Leaders program. I wrote #APromisedLand in part because I hoped to reach young people like those in this group—the unique voices of a new generation, energized and unafraid to dream big. https://t.co/LP1Ri8Epva

Michelle and I are thinking of everyone across the country braving the winter storms this week. Here’s an overview of how you can help—or, if you’re in Texas, where you can go to stay warm or get support. https://t.co/zDnLrjOZ5i
