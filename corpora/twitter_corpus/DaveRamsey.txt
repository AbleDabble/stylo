Too many “smart financial people” reject simple money practices. BIG mistake. Never confuse “smart” with “wise”.

You should own your home, NOT let it own you. A mortgage payment should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay. 

If you're ready to buy, get in touch with a TRUSTED real estate agent that will respect your budget. url

Financial success is about what you have IN the bank, not what you owe TO the bank.
