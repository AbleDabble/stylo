Jesus was not condemning bigger barns, he was condemning the man’s attitude, motivation, for the bigger barns.

A weak man believes and repeats all he hears. The feeling of having the inside scoop makes him feel bigger than he is. - @MansfieldWrites

Too many “smart financial people” reject simple money practices. BIG mistake. Never confuse “smart” with “wise”.

You should own your home, NOT let it own you. A mortgage payment should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay. 

If you're ready to buy, get in touch with a TRUSTED real estate agent that will respect your budget. https://t.co/nMZvYa1BGb

Financial success is about what you have IN the bank, not what you owe TO the bank.

The IRS has moved the federal tax deadline from April 15 to May 17.

This impacts federal taxes for individuals. Keep in mind, this move does not change state deadlines or quarterly estimates. 

Don't put things off. If you can, just go ahead and file your taxes.

The S&amp;P 500 is talked about a LOT, so it's important to understand what it is. https://t.co/TSBr05fJ8A

God feeds the birds, but he doesn't throw the worms into the nest. Rise and shine, hustle and grind.

Yes, there's a third stimulus on the way — but that's not all.

Few people can be credited with literally starting an industry, but Rush was the Elvis of Talk Radio, he invented it. There will be attempts to fill his shoes, but none of us can. RIP my friend, you will be missed.

America and Radio lost a great man and a good friend today. Rush’s humor, intellect, and passion catapulted him to become an American icon. You had to love him or hate him, he didn’t give you a choice…I loved him.

Our pleasure sir. Glad to have you https://t.co/zArdM9KZeI
