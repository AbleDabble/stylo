Thank you for all the birthday wishes, and all the special things you’ve been doing to celebrate it. Feeling very lucky today, and all the days. Love love love, H

TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS. OUT NOW.

url url

I really hope to play these shows and will have news for you in the new year on when they will take place. I can’t wait to see you all on the road as soon as it’s safe to do so. Treat people with kindness.

Everyone’s health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone my UK and European shows planned for Feb/March 2021 until further notice.

Fine Line is one year old. I couldn’t be more grateful for you all continually finding new ways to change my life. Thank you for listening, and for everything else. I always love you, but especially today. H url

Bring back manly men. url

I’m incredibly thankful for so much this year. I hope everyone is staying safe and being good to each other. Happy Thanksgiving. Love, H

I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021 but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months. I can’t wait to see you all on the road as soon as it’s safe to do so.

Everyone’s health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice.

I’m heartbroken by Tuesday’s tragedy in Lebanon. Thinking of all those affected and sending love to everyone in Beirut. I’ve donated to the link below. If you’re able to, please give what you can. url

And finally.. to the boys, I love you so much, and I couldn’t be prouder of everything we achieved together. Here’s to ten. H

And for that, I will be forever thankful. I just can’t believe it’s been ten years. Thank you to our crew, our team, and everyone else who helped us along the way. To all the fans, I love you, and I thank you with all my heart. You did it all, and you changed everything.

I’ve had the pleasure of meeting and working with some of the most incredible people, and gained friendships that I know I will treasure for the rest of my life. None of this would be possible without the support you’ve given along the way.

I’ve been struggling to put into words how grateful I am for everything that’s happened over the last ten years. I’ve seen things and places that I’d only ever dreamt of when I was growing up. url

I will be using this time to listen, and to educate myself on how I can help more in the fight for justice and equal rights for all in the future. I hope that you will take the time to do the same. Treat people with kindness. I love you all. H

The well-being of my crew, and all the fans around the world will always hold top priority. I can’t wait to see you all out on the road, as soon as it’s safe to do so. We are in a moment of necessary change and growth in the world.

This summer we were excited to be bringing Love On Tour to North America. However, due to the ongoing threat from Covid-19 we have been forced to reschedule these dates to next summer. url

I’m donating to help post bail for arrested organizers.
Look inwards, educate yourself and others. 
LISTEN, READ, SHARE, DONATE and VOTE. 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
BLACK LIVES MATTER.

I do things every day without fear, because I am privileged, and I am privileged every day because I am white.

Being not racist is not enough, we must be anti racist.
Social change is enacted when a society mobilizes. 
I stand in solidarity with all of those protesting. url

JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. Practice social distancing. Watermelon Sugar Video Out Now.

For the safety of yourself and others, please self-isolate. We’re all in this together.

For obvious reasons, the upcoming tour in the UK and Europe will be rescheduled to 2021. Tickets already purchased will be valid for these shows. In the meantime, we will be closely monitoring the situation around the world and will continue updating you in the months to come.

Anyone who knows me, knows that performing has always been my favorite part of working in music.
 
However, during times like these, the safety and protection of touring crew, fans, and everyone else around the world is an immediate priority. url
