Tomorrow I'm on @TheEllenShow , talking about ....you guessed it #dogecoin ! https://t.co/oSUEqK6sus

Because Doge is the one coin that people actually use for transactions.  We take many others via @BitPay . But people spend their Doge and that means more businesses will start taking it. The greatest inhibitor to it's growth is that you can't spend the Doge you buy on Robinhood https://t.co/TrhT9pYkcb

Just talked to my friends at @BitPay, they do the Mavs Doge sales. Not only do the Mavs sales continue to grow, but @Bitpay says they are on track to do 6k Doge transactions in April !  üöÄüöÄüöÄ

@BitCloutPrivate @merket @jakeudell @chamath No. They are anonymous. You won‚Äôt know they are me

@merket @jakeudell @chamath And my 2014 position on btc was as right then as it is now. It‚Äôs a store of value and not a currency. But I do wish I had taken more of a flyer on it :). Fortunately I did buy a bunch of eth

@merket @jakeudell @chamath I have 2 accounts on bitclout. Both with my 36c for adding a phone number. I‚Äôve posted. I‚Äôve read through posts. There isn‚Äôt a lot of traffic so it isn‚Äôt hard. It‚Äôs not that this can‚Äôt work. It just can‚Äôt work as is

@OurielOhayon @StartupBros @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath Except it doesn‚Äôt change. You don‚Äôt get paid for your time. You get paid  for your popularity

@StartupBros @OurielOhayon @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath You get 36c and then they ask for $51 to have coins to do more.

@OurielOhayon @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath Name one of your examples that was pay to play ? You can deal with Boring till the network effect kicks in because it‚Äôs free.  Bitclout is not free to fully use

@merket @jakeudell @chamath All appreciable assets are built on ‚Äúget long and get loud ‚Äú. The difference here is that you have to pay to join ‚Äúthe club‚Äù and bring in or sell new members on your coin to see it appreciate.  It really is a bastardized MLM version of GoFundMe

@merket @jakeudell @chamath Reddit wasn‚Äôt the business model under question. And it‚Äôs mostly hustle porn. Not passion. Big Difference. Name one business model built on social that was pay to play? This truly is the MLM of  crypto. Pay to sign up and get your friends to buy your token. Then they do the same

@ThorTorrens @jakeudell @chamath Social shouldn't be pay to play

@ClayPerryMusic @ThorTorrens @jakeudell @chamath That's great !  How much have you invested so far ?

@jakeudell @chamath Of course I remember. You did a great tjob with Krewella

@GSUS19207360 @jakeudell @chamath You have to spend money to participate. The whole point is to decide whose coins to buy. Isn't it ?

@ClayPerryMusic @jakeudell @chamath I went on a few hours ago. It was 90pct or more

@ThorTorrens @jakeudell @chamath I browsed the top users and universal feed. My coin has some real value. So I had financial incentive to sign up. But I didn't see anything truly social and the last thing I wanted to do was try to sell people, directly or indirectly, on buying my coin.

@jakeudell @chamath I browsed the global feed . Its almost all BitClout Porn. Its not that you cant build a community. You can.. around BitClout. That is not going to get it to compete for mass adoption

@heybuddyheypal @chamath none

@chamath The problem is that its a social network that isnt social at all.  IMHO, you made an enormous mistake by showing the pricing and requiring people to have coins to participate.  People cant be social. They have to try to do things that increase their value. Big Difference.

@See_Hendo They left out the rest of the interview where I say they get along great.

@ccaberlon By the mavs bench on the other side

@ishooku @SullyCNBC I told IU that I would never put my name on a building. I paid for an advanced media school but I required them to use existing space.  I won‚Äôt do anything that will increase tuition

@ishooku @SullyCNBC I‚Äôve said it many times to rich people. Every time you build a new building the cost of tuition goes up. Those buildings eat money forever.  Stop having a separate building for bus, psych, sociology etc.  they don‚Äôt need their own buildings.  That‚Äôs vanity that costs kids cash

@SullyCNBC @ishooku The key is what price is set for the gov to pay. If it‚Äôs current tuition it will be a disaster.  They should put it out to bid. Then let the one or two schools per region with lowest cost be free. Even better would be to require kids to go to free community college first
