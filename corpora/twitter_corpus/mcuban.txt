@mulegirl How much time have you spent learning about smart contracts and how they work and what applications they excel at ?

@mulegirl In your example you are completely dependent on the parties to perform with the courts as your means of enforcement. None of those are required with smart contracts. If you can define the agreement with data triggers a smart contract is far far better  url

You are showing you don't understand the technology behind NFTs.  A textbook can be an NFT that is sold and resold with perpetual  royalties going to the publisher. An insurance contract can be an NFT.  A ticket to an event can be an NFT. The list is endless url

Only a fool would buy 100 stocks or 100 crypto assets. But let me ask a question. What rights do you have as a shareholder in any public company stock you have bought? url

Yes there is massive speculation.  Just as there has been at the inflection point of every new technology.  And every single one of the technologies has been dismissed by legacy institutions.  Until they weren't

Or would you prefer to work with a deterministic, distributed system that is not built on trusting those companies but rather built on a transparent set of rules that are out in the open for anyone to see ? These are the reasons crypto has taken off.

Look at all the financial interactions you have in your life for banking, insurance, buying and selling where you have to trust faceless, nameless people working for a company whose decisions can change your life. Would you prefer to continue to trust them ?

If you look at crypto assets whether eth, doge, btc,mkr etc and only see something intangible  for people to trade, you haven't really looked. If you see smart contracts and programming languages and  think of new ways to disrupt industries then I'm saying there's a chance

NFTs for digital collectibles are an example of an application, as are smart contracts for weather insurance are an example, DeFi to allow anyone to be a lender or a borrower in minutes,
, buying off-chain products with on chain assets, the applications will only grow

Let me help you. L1 and L2 based chains are deterministic, programmable platforms that can be used to create applications that can  increase productivity. Their "coins" provide the ability for coin owners to benefit from the value created. Not all will succeed but many will. url

When was the last time you looked at your bank account and felt like you had more money to spend and things got cheaper? Doge might not go up , but I‚Äôm saying there is a chance. That‚Äôs why url

@CoinDesk @TheEllenShow This is exactly why people will buy physical products with doge coin and not with btc and rarely with eth.   It‚Äôs hard for someone with $100 to get excited about owning a fraction of btc or eth.  It‚Äôs easy with doge. When it appreciates that makes those items easy 2 buy

@CoinDesk Now this is a topic that all daytime tv viewers would be riveted by.

@CoinDesk @TheEllenShow Any asset that has inflation by definition is ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù nut that doesn‚Äôt diminish it. It changes the utility from store of value to potentially a digital currency.   It‚Äôs the fact that they create 5b a yr that keeps the per coin price low, which makes it more accessible

Tomorrow I'm on @TheEllenShow , talking about ....you guessed it #dogecoin ! url

Because Doge is the one coin that people actually use for transactions.  We take many others via @BitPay . But people spend their Doge and that means more businesses will start taking it. The greatest inhibitor to it's growth is that you can't spend the Doge you buy on Robinhood url

Just talked to my friends at @BitPay, they do the Mavs Doge sales. Not only do the Mavs sales continue to grow, but @Bitpay says they are on track to do 6k Doge transactions in April !  üöÄüöÄüöÄ

@merket @jakeudell @chamath And my 2014 position on btc was as right then as it is now. It‚Äôs a store of value and not a currency. But I do wish I had taken more of a flyer on it :). Fortunately I did buy a bunch of eth

@merket @jakeudell @chamath I have 2 accounts on bitclout. Both with my 36c for adding a phone number. I‚Äôve posted. I‚Äôve read through posts. There isn‚Äôt a lot of traffic so it isn‚Äôt hard. It‚Äôs not that this can‚Äôt work. It just can‚Äôt work as is

@OurielOhayon @StartupBros @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath Except it doesn‚Äôt change. You don‚Äôt get paid for your time. You get paid  for your popularity

@StartupBros @OurielOhayon @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath You get 36c and then they ask for $51 to have coins to do more.

@OurielOhayon @tyson_flows @jakeudell @chamath Name one of your examples that was pay to play ? You can deal with Boring till the network effect kicks in because it‚Äôs free.  Bitclout is not free to fully use

@merket @jakeudell @chamath All appreciable assets are built on ‚Äúget long and get loud ‚Äú. The difference here is that you have to pay to join ‚Äúthe club‚Äù and bring in or sell new members on your coin to see it appreciate.  It really is a bastardized MLM version of GoFundMe

@merket @jakeudell @chamath Reddit wasn‚Äôt the business model under question. And it‚Äôs mostly hustle porn. Not passion. Big Difference. Name one business model built on social that was pay to play? This truly is the MLM of  crypto. Pay to sign up and get your friends to buy your token. Then they do the same

@ClayPerryMusic @ThorTorrens @jakeudell @chamath That's great !  How much have you invested so far ?

@jakeudell @chamath Of course I remember. You did a great tjob with Krewella

@GSUS19207360 @jakeudell @chamath You have to spend money to participate. The whole point is to decide whose coins to buy. Isn't it ?

@ClayPerryMusic @jakeudell @chamath I went on a few hours ago. It was 90pct or more

@ThorTorrens @jakeudell @chamath I browsed the top users and universal feed. My coin has some real value. So I had financial incentive to sign up. But I didn't see anything truly social and the last thing I wanted to do was try to sell people, directly or indirectly, on buying my coin.

One of the best uses of NFTs ever !

 Check out and buy @IsiahWhitlockJr's  infamous "Sheeet " line in NFT form  at url. The lazy way to show off your NFTs! url

@jakeudell @chamath I browsed the global feed . Its almost all BitClout Porn. Its not that you cant build a community. You can.. around BitClout. That is not going to get it to compete for mass adoption
