"Endeavour arriving!" Welcome to the @Space_Station, Crew-2! 

Their arrival means there are now 11 humans aboard our orbiting laboratory, a number not seen since the space shuttle era. Hugs abound. https://t.co/uSwW3JFl6K

@CaveManTV_ Yes, beginning at 4:45am ET on Wed., April 28, NASA TV will air Crew-1 hatch closure, followed by undocking coverage starting at 6:45am. A current broadcast schedule is available here: https://t.co/wOxN82TbYX

@kunal52294045 Yes, the @Space_Station is powered by eight solar arrays, 112 feet long by 39 feet wide, that convert sunlight to electricity. During their upcoming mission, the Crew-2 astronauts are scheduled to augment the existing solar arrays with new ones: https://t.co/4qvgCEYWH2

@Lupajoro Planners are practiced at adapting to varying numbers of astronauts on station. The record during visiting space shuttle missions was 13 people for short periods of time. There will be 11 once Crew-2 arrives, until the departure of four Crew-1 astronauts on Wed., April 28.

@kunal52294045 Some of them will return to Earth next week! Four astronauts now on the @Space_Station ‚Äî the SpaceX Crew-1 mission ‚Äî are scheduled to depart aboard the Crew Dragon Resilience spacecraft on Wed., April 28.

@jamcroz20 @Space_Station The Crew Dragon is actually matching the speed of the ISS, so it only appears that way - both are traveling at about 17,500 mph!
