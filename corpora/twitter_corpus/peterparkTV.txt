Thank you to everyone that's reached out, I am currently talking and pursuing some potentially viable treatments for his condition and just hoping for the best. I love and appreciate you all.

Today, Peepo tested positive for FIP, a feline disease that is usually fatal when diagnosed. I'll be taking some time off to explore my options to see how we can best treat him and potentially prepare for the worst case scenario.

I am just at a loss.
