@RetailProphet @aburtch I agree with you both in regard to search through voice (vs the current point-and-click approach). That will be a natural evolution, or should I say technological evolution.

@DanyAllstar15 First and foremost this word 'Fact' I don't think it means what you think it means. So, no, it's NOT fact... it's an opinion. Speaking of opinion it is mine that the best way to compare the dominance of athletes from different eras is 2 see how much above their peers they are.

@ShawnKanungo First of all, you're just saying that to prove that you're that much younger than me. Second of all, when it comes to  enligjtening each other you have so much more credit in the bank than I do. I always look forward to your insights.

@MichelleKHarper Was not talking about that particular case specifically. What I was referencing was the default to claiming #CancelCulture anytime somebody confronts them with a justifiable consequence to their actions or inactions.

@MichelleKHarper I was thinking that same thing the past few weeks. Is this a case where kids are going to be complaining about #CancelCulture because they get grounded for doing something stupid?

@ShawnKanungo So true Shawn. And in a related way I'd add that the world is not lacking for new ideas it is lacking ways of putting those ideas into play. 

Implementing said ideas, Innovations, or protocols is what, often, takes courage.

@AdamMGrant It seems the fear of being perceived or judged as one that would not put forward their best effort is what the issue. It takes courage to put out (a new product or service) which you obviously know is not, yet, as good as it could be.

@JoJoFromJerz What's that supposed to be? An airing of a grievance?

@CBCMusic It's not my absolute favourite but I'm still quite intrigued by the interpretation of the origin of Christmas in this one. And that would be Spaceman Came Travelling by Chris de Burgh.

Very late 70s-ish.

@JerrySeinfeld In it's please can we temporarily have Feasting on Wings as one of the #Festivus tenets. If they're hot it could be the #EatsOfStrength.

When I was 6yrs I called  Dec 23rd 'Christmas Adam'. Because it was the day before Christmas Eve. I held out hope for decades that perhaps it might catch on with at least 2 or 3 others. But I've resigned to the fact that #Festivus has taken over that day. https://t.co/4R1iXuWP9P
